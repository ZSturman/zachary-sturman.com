**Shadow Brother**
When dreams bleed into reality

**By Zachary Sturman**

  

**Introduction**

  

**I screamed and hollered. The pain was too much. The doctors rolled me into the operating room. They picked me up off the stretcher and put me on the operating table. My leg was in so much pain. I didn’t think I was going to live. I had know idea how much the infection had grown. The doctors started to put me under. The lights began to fade as my eyes fell shut. I knew that it was just a matter of time before I could get up and go back home. It felt like hours have gone by, then I woke up. I thought that the operation was over, but it wasn’t! It hadn’t even begun. I was only out of it for a few minutes. I could still feel the pain in my leg. I tried to scream, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t move or say anything. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I didn’t** 

**feel safe I was sure I was going to die. I didn’t even know if they had gotten the bullet out of my leg yet. I looked down and saw all of the black and blue around where I was stabbed. I looked over at my arm and saw that it was still swollen like a melon. I was scared to death because I still didn’t know what happened to my new best friend or my soul.**

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

It all started when I was just a little boy at the age of 9. My mom and me lived in a small 

town in Missouri. My dad died before I was born, my name is Zach Thompson. It was a day just like any other. It was cloudy outside, it looked like rain. My best friend was Chase Monsdeoca. One day he came over to my house. 

    “I’m moving.” He said.

   “What!?”

    “Yeah. I’m going to Colorado.” He began, “My dad got a new job. He’s going to get paid a lot more, we’re going to have a big house and everything!”

    “But we were going to do the talent show and we were going to make a club and everything.” I whined.

    “Sorry, I can’t do anything about it. That’s all.”

    “Well, when are you leaving?” I asked.

    “Tomorrow.” He answered.   

    “TOMORROW!!” I screamed, “And you couldn’t have told me earlier?”

    “Well, I just found out about it a month ago.” He replied. I looked at him with a puzzled look. A month ago, I thought, man! See I wouldn’t be that mad about it, except he was one of my only friends. I wasn’t actually the cool kid at my school. I was one of those kids who always sat at the lunch table unaccompanied when he was gone. So that’s why I didn’t want him to leave. It took me 9 years of my life to meet my first best friend, it’ll take me almost another decade to meet another. 

     “Let’s try and have as much fun as we can before you leave.”

     “M’kay.” So I got out my Nintendo 64 and we played sonic. It was fun for about 10 minutes. Then we got bored. So we went outside and swung on my swing set. Subsequently it started raining so I had to go back inside, I stopped on the porch when Chase started talking to me. “Hey, I have to go home now. My mom doesn’t like me at your house when it rains ‘cause… well bye!” 

     “Wait, why doesn’t your mom like you over at my house when it rains?” I asked.

     “Well you know how your mom gets.”

     “No, I don’t.” I replied.

     “She always gets all protective and says ‘If you go outside you’ll get struck by lightning,’ and ‘don’t stay out to long or you’ll get a cold’ ”

     “Fine, bye.” I said as I walked inside and he walked away. I walked into my room, slamming the door behind me. I wish there was some way Chase wouldn’t have to move. I would do anything. I muttered to myself. I lied down in my bed and stared at the ceiling. After about 10 minutes I fell asleep. That’s when I began to dream. It was about me, going over to Chase’s house. It was night time in my dream too. I crept over leisurely, not making a sound, into his parents room. I took a long stare at Chase’s dad. I reached down and stuffed my hand into my sock. I slowly pulled out a knife and stabbed his dad over and over again in the heart so he would die. I woke up. My head flew up off my pillow as I was screaming. I looked out the window and it was storming exceedingly brutal. 

     “What’s wrong?” My mom asked flying in through the door.

     “Nothing, bad dream.” I answered breathing heavily.

     “Okay, if you say so.” My mom said as she left the room closing the door slowly. I looked at the clock. It was 3:49, so I decided to go back to sleep, but every time I closed my eyes I could see myself killing him. So I got up and went to the bathroom. I splashed water over my face to try and make me forget about it. 

     I left the bathroom and went back to my bed. I closed my eyes, I couldn’t see me killing Chase’s dad. That was a relief. Then I fell asleep.

  

  

  

  

Chapter 2

 When I woke up it was 8:20. Fortunately it was Sunday and I didn’t have to go to school. I walked over to Chase’s house that was about 4 houses down. I went inside to say goodbye to Chase. When I got there, there was nothing but boxes everywhere. I walked to Chase’s room to see him unpacking. “What are you doing?” I asked Chase.

     “I’m unpacking, what does it look like?”

     “It looks like you’re unpacking. But why?”   

     “I’m not moving.” 

     “O dear god! Is your dad dead?” I asked worried.

     “What? No. He’s alive.” Chase looked at me kind of suspicious. He closed his eyes and shook his head, “But someone else died. That’s why my dad can’t get the job!”

     “Oh, that makes perfect sense” I replied sarcastically.

     “You see, this one guy died on the job and his family is suing the company, and they can’t hire my dad because they won’t have enough money after the law suit to pay him.”

     “That’s awesome! That means we are able to do the talent show and we are able to make a club and… wait! Why aren’t you happier?”

     “I was kind of excited about having a big house and going to a rich people’s school.”

     “What! Oh so that’s how you wanna be well, fine. I hate you why won’t you just die!” Me and Chase started laughing because of course I was joking. I helped Chase unpack. After we were done we went to the park and played. It was fun because we met some other kids there, except they were like 2 years older so they thought they were hot stuff and that they knew everything that there was to know. So we played with them, but when they started acting all _cool_ we just ignored them. After that me and Chase went home. He came back over to my house again and we played Nintendo again. Suddenly it started getting all cloudy outside again. 

     “Wow, it looks like its gonna rain again.” Chase pointed out, like I didn’t know already. So of course that meant that Chase had to go home.

Chase left and I was home, again, alone, bored. I walked into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator to see what there was to eat. I looked up and down trying to find something. There was nothing that looked appetizing. I walked over to the cabinets and looked in there. Nothing. I rubbed my eyes and looked at the clock. It was 4:00 in the afternoon. I walked into my room and looked around. All of my games are two or more player games. I grabbed monopoly, sorry and chess and walked into the living room. I sat down in front of the TV and waited for my mom to get home. She never gets home until about 4:30, so I flipped through all the channels and found something that looked good. It was _The Simpsons._ After Bart Simpson stole the head of the statue in the middle of town, I walked back into the kitchen hoping to find something good to eat again. I grabbed the loaf of bread and pulled out a couple slices. I through them into the toaster. I walked over to the silverware drawer and pulled out a knife. I walked back over to the fridge and grabbed the butter. I stared at the toaster waiting for it to get done. It was taking to long so I walked over to where the glasses are. I pulled one out and walked over to the refrigerator. I grabbed the milk and began to pour. I set the glass on the counter and put the milk back into the refrigerator. I heard the toast pop up and so I grabbed it and put it on a plate. I opened the lid on the butter and smeared it onto the toast. I put the butter back in the fridge, grabbed my toast and my glass of milk and sat down on the couch. By the time _The Simpsons_ were over I had completely finished my food. I looked out the window to see my mom pull up into the drive way. I stared at the door waiting for her to open the door. I was awaiting her smiling face staring at me ready to play. Instead I got a big surprise. She threw the door open drenched in water. She had large bags under her eyes. She threw her purse onto the table and walked to her room. She didn’t even take a second look at me. I folded my arms and leaned back against the couch depressed. The rest of the day it rained, and my mom never came out of her room. I new better not to bother mom when she’s in a bad mood. So I didn’t.    

That night I had another dream, like the one the night before I was killing someone. I had a gun in my hand; I walked into Chase’s house. I thought that I was going to go into Chase’s mom and dad’s room and kill his dad again, but I didn’t. I walked into Chase’s room to see him sleeping. I put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger. He was dead. Once again I woke up screaming. I looked out the window, it was still raining. I looked at the clock. It was like 2 in the morning. Once again my mom came in the room.

“What’s wrong?”

     “Nothing mom. Another bad dream.”

      “Okay. Do you want to talk about it?”

      “Uh… no!” 

      “Well good night.” My mom said as she walked out of the room shutting the door slowly. I tried to go back to sleep, but I couldn’t. I sat there; I did the same thing I did the night before. I got up and went to the bathroom and splashed water in my face. 

     “Get a hold of yourself!” I told myself. “You’re not going to go kill anyone.” So then I walked back to my bed and went to sleep.

  

Chapter 3

 When I woke up the next morning it was about 7:00. So I got up, got my stuff together and went to school. When I got there I found Chase sitting at his desk. I walked over to him and started talking to him. 

    “Did anything weird happen to you last night?” I asked.

    “Um… no. Why do you ask?”

    “No reason. Did your dad say anything happened to him two nights ago?”

    “Once again no. And once again why do you ask?” He asked with an attitude.

    “Why are you so mad, is it that time of the month ag…!” Then I threw my hand over my mouth as the teacher walked by. Luckily the teacher didn’t do anything. After the teacher was gone Chase gave me one of those looks. There telling you that they don’t want any crap from you. 

    “Were you just about to call me a girl?” Chase argued.

    “Actually, yes because you’re acting all pissy.” Chase jumped out of his seat and tackled 

me to the floor. He took his fist and punched me in the face over and over again as hard as he could. 

    “What is your problem! Stop! Stop! Get off me faggot! Go die!” I yelled as loud as I could. The teacher came over and pulled Chase off me. Chase was sent to the office and I was sent to the nurse. She put a Kleenex on my really bloody nose and lip. I sat there for a few minutes, then the bleeding stopped. I left and went back to class. I made it all the way to 1:00 when the Counselor came through the door. I looked up and he gave me a signal to come with him somewhere. He took me to his office.

    “Did you find anything different about Chase in the past couple of days?”

    “He was going to move, then he didn’t.” I answered.

    “No did you find anything different about his attitude?”

    “Well, he was all pissy this morning.”

    “Excuse me? That is not a word we use at this school.”

    “Sorry, he was acting all moody this morning.”

    “Well, I talked to him earlier today and he told me that he had a weird dream last night. Do you know anything about this?” He asked me suspiciously. Now I was really scared. If he had a weird dream, and I had a weird dream, could it mean something?

    “No, I don’t.”

    “Well he said that he had a dream about you in his room, with a gun. He said that it felt real. He said that you put a gun against his head and killed him. He thought that it might be a sign.”

    “Wow that is really… strange. I mean to have a dream like that.” Oh god! What if he really was going to die!

    “Maybe you should go talk to Chase, okay?” the counselor suggested. 

    “Okay.” The counselor walked me to the office to where Chase was sitting. They put me and Chase in a little room by ourselves to talk. 

    “Why did you attack me?” I asked Chase.

    “I want to ask you the same question.” Chase said back to me.

    “What?” I was thinking in my head, when did I ever attack him.

    “Last night…” Chase took a small pause like he was still debating whether or not to tell me. “I had a dream that you came in my room and put a gun to my head and killed me. When I woke up, scared to death, I looked in the mirror, and do you know what I saw?”

    “No. What did you see?” I didn’t know what he was about to say. 

    “I saw you. I saw you standing right behind me. You had a gun. Then you ran off out my window. I was scared. Then I tried to fall back to sleep. But I…”

    “What! I was in my room… sleeping at that time! How could I have been there too?”

    “I don’t know, but I know what I saw.”

    “How do you know that you weren’t dreaming then too?”

    “Because I never went back to sleep!”

  

Chapter 4

    I couldn’t take it. I was getting to scared. I was feeling my heart pumping. I had to leave! So I got up and ran out the door. The principal tried to grab me, but I got away. As I was running down the hall, I knew that I was in trouble because I ran away from the principal when she tried to grab me. I had to think of something fast. I didn’t want to get in trouble, but I had to get home. So I thought of something. I ran to the bathroom. There were several boys in there so I had to make it look real to have witnesses. I went to one of the stalls and put my finger in the back of my throat and made myself throw up. I made all the noises, so I knew that the boys would say I really puked. When I got out the principal was standing right there. I told her that I was really sick and I had to throw up. Then when the other boys told her that I did, she believed me. 

    “That’s why I had to run away really fast.” I told her. So she let me go to the nurse and I called my mom. She came and got me. While we were in the car my mom started talking to me. 

    “The principal called me today. I hear you and Chase got into a fight. He won apparently.” 

    “It wasn’t a fair. He just jumped on me out of no where and started punching me in the face. He completely lost it.”

    “You must have really made him mad. What did you do?” My mom looked at me and back at the road. What was I supposed to say. I just let something blurt out.

    “He thought that I hated him.” I didn’t know what else to say.

    “So he beat you up?” I didn’t reply. When I got home I started thinking of everything that happened. First time I had one of those weird dreams was when I killed Chase’s dad. Why did I have that dream though? Oh right! I didn’t want Chase to move so I… I… I said that I would do anything for him not to move. If I were to kill Chase’s dad, that means that they wouldn’t move because Chase’s dad was the one getting the job. I need to go ask Chase’s dad if he noticed anything weird 2 nights ago. So I started running out the front door when my mom stopped me.

     “Where do you think you’re going?” My mom asked me.

     “I’m going over to Chase’s house.”

     “What! I thought that he beat you up at school today.”

      “Um, yeah but…” I started when my mom interrupted me

     “And he won’t be home for another two hours!”

      “Yeah but… I was just going to talk to his dad.”

      “Why!” My mom asked.

      “Well because I was going to ask his dad… why Chase beat me up.”

      “No, you can stay home. And isn’t his dad at work?”

     “No,  he quit his job cause he thought he was going to get a new job. But since he didn’t get the new job, he tried to get his old job back, but they already replaced him.”

     “Oh, well you can just stay home. Remember your sick.”

     “What?” I was confused. I’m not… Oh crap! “Oh yeah. I’m sick. I think I’m going to go lay down now.” By this time my mom knew I was faking, but she didn’t seem to care. So I went back to my room and called Chase’s dad. 

     “Hello.” Chase’s dad said when he answered the phone.

     “Hi, this is Zach.”

      “Sorry, Chase isn’t home but even if he was he was, I doubt that he wants to talk to you.”

     “No, I want to talk to you.”

      “What?”

      “I want to ask you some things.”

      “O... kay?” Chase’s dad said very confused.

      “Two nights ago did you have a weird dream.” The silence on the other end of the phone was an obvious yes.

      “Um… yeah I did.”

      “What was it about?” I asked.

      “You know what, I don’t really have time for this.”

      “Please, it will only take a second.”

      “Fine, I did have a weird dream about you for some odd reason. You killed me.”

      “What happened when you woke up and you were scared to death?”

      “What, I didn’t wake up? I don’t get scared in the middle of the night.”

      “Oh, okay that’s all.” Then Chase’s dad hung up without even saying goodbye. So now I had a little more to think about. Obviously something weird is going on, but what? After I woke up from having that dream I went to the bathroom and said ‘I don’t wanna kill him.’ Could that have done something? Then the next day the other guy died. But, why didn’t I have a dream about him dying. Maybe it’s because my dreams and him dying aren’t even connected. Then the next night I dreamed about killing Chase. But I never wanted to kill him, I never said anything about wanting to kill him. Wait, I did say that I wanted him to die, but I was just joking. Maybe they didn’t know that. THEY! Who’s they? Oh man, now I have even more to think about. I was getting to stressed out. I knew that I have to keep trying to figure this out. Okay, whenever I had the dream about killing Chase, he had the same dream. Obviously he had the same dream. That’s when he looked in the mirror and I went to the bathroom. He saw me in his room, and he saw me run away out of his room. Probably the same time when I called off killing him! That’s it! If I call off killing the people, they won’t die in real life. And I have the dream of me killing them as a warning to me. They have the same dream as a warning to them. And when I wake up, I have a chance to call off me killing them. And if I don’t call it off, then they might die! But what do I know. It could also just be a huge coincidence.

  

Chapter 5

        When I looked outside, it was cloudy again. “I don’t want to kill Chase” I said to myself. So then I went and sat down on my bed. I hadn’t noticed how long I had been thinking about everything that had happened. It had been almost 5 hours. My mom called me out for dinner. I came out and sat down. It was still cloudy.  

     “What’s the matter?” My mom asked.

     “What?”

     “You keep looking outside, are you expecting someone?”

     “No. Did the weather guy say anything about it storming again tonight?”

     “Nope, they said it should be sunny. What do they know though? They have been wrong three days in a row. Now eat your pasta, it’s getting cold.”

     “Did they say anything about why it’s storming?”

     “No, no they didn’t. Why are you so worried about the weather all the sudden?” I didn’t know what to tell her, I only start asking about things if I’m actually worried about it.

     “Well, I was curious if I was going to have school tomorrow.”

     “I doubt that it would rain that hard.” That’s when I started thinking. What If I didn’t want school tomorrow? Could I make it rain so hard that I wouldn’t have school? 

     “I wish that I wouldn’t have school tomorrow.” 

     “Why not?” My mom asked.

     “I don’t know, just don’t.” After twenty minutes, I went back to my room and sat on my bed to think. It was about 6:30 when it started raining. I was just sitting there when all of the sudden my stomach started to hurt. It hurt really bad. I wasn’t sure if it was the pasta or from making me throw up earlier that day. I walked out of my room holding my stomach and I told my mom that I wasn’t feeling good. That’s when I started getting a bad fever. My mom laid me down on the couch and took my temperature. It was 101. I was groaning and moaning in pain. I got up and took a sleeping pill. I fell asleep after about and hour on the couch. That night I had another bad dream. This dream was the weirdest dream I have ever had. It was like my spirit or something stepping out of my body. Then my soul looked down at my body and it punched me over and over in my stomach. Then my spirit went in the kitchen, took a frying pan and put it over the stove. I took the pan and hit my face again and again. My face was bright red from all the heat of the pan. Then, once again I woke up screaming.     

     My mom came running in the living room to see me lying down on the couch screaming. Usually I would’ve stopped screaming by now but there was something in the corner of the room. Someone hiding in the shadows. Its stepped forward.

It was me.

  

Chapter 6

    “MOM!” I screamed at the top of my lungs! She hadn’t seen it yet. When she turned to where I was pointing, the person ran through the wall and left. My mom didn’t look in time. 

    “What is it?” She asked in concern.

    “It was me! I was in the corner of the room.”

    “Oh god, your face is bright red,” She put her hand against my cheeks and forehead, “You’re burning up!”

    “Mom, you’re not listening! It was m….!”  

    “I’m calling the doctor and making an appointment.” My mom left the room and grabbed the phone. That’s when the person who looked just like me ran back through the wall and jumped back into me body. I didn’t know what just happened. Was that my spirit? If it was, why did it beat me up in my dream? Was it about to beat me up right then? I looked at the clock; it was 3:51 in the morning. I couldn’t fall asleep that night, all I could think about was what just happened. If that was my spirit, why would it want to beat me up? Wait, I said that I didn’t want to go to school. My spirit must’ve known that if I was sick I wouldn’t have to go to school today. If that was my spirit and it was out of my body, why did I not feel any different in my normal body? That day my mom put me in the car and took me off to the doctors. It was about 9:00 in the morning and my mom looked mad. On the way to the doctors I asked my mom some questions.

     “Why am I going to the doctors? I feel much better today.”

     “Because of what you said last night.” My mom answered with an attitude.

    “But you have to believe me! I really did see myself in the corner of the room; it was going to beat me up!”

    “We’ll be to the doctors in just a little bit.”

     “I’m not sick mom! You’ve got to believe me!” I whined. I didn’t want to go to the doctors. Hey, I just realized, I’m not going to school. It worked! That’s why it was going to beat me up, because if I got sick then that would mean I would have to stay home. Well, I don’t want to get sick, so I’m not going to say I don’t want to school again. I would rather not die. “Please mom, I don’t want to go to the doctors!” 

     “You’re going to the doctors whether you want to or not.” I didn’t want to talk to my mom any more; she was getting really mad for some reason. Once we got to the doctors I had to sit down on the little table that has the paper over it. The doctor asked my mom what seemed to be the problem. “Well, he threw up yesterday and he was hallucinating last night.”

      “What did he see Mrs. Thompson?” The doctor asked.

      “It’s Ms.” My mom corrected him. “Well, he said he seen himself in the corner of the room.”

      “What?” The doctor had a puzzled look on his face.

      “That’s what he said, he saw. He saw himself in the corner of the living room.” 

      “Did anything else happen last night or yesterday?”

      “He did get beat up bye this boy.”

      “You know what,” The doctor began saying, “I think that we should do a quick x-ray and see if this boy did any damage to your son Mrs. Thompson.”

      “Ms.” My mom said again. I had a strange feeling that she was flirting with the doctor. The doctor walked over to me and told me to follow him. Going to the doctor isn’t really that bad unless you get the kind of doctor that treats you like your three. 

       “Ok Champ, this way.” He walked with me into a dark room. There was a little light over another one of those little tables with paper over it. I lay down on the table and the doctor left. After about a minute I started hearing his voice through a speaker. “Just stay still and we’re going to get a couple pictures of your innards, okay buddy?” I didn’t reply. A couple of bright lights flashed and I heard the doctor again. “I’m going to need you to flip over on your stomach now little dude.” I wanted to jump off the table and strangle him to death because he kept calling me those stupid little names. But I did what he asked. Another quick flash and it was done. I got up off the table and walked outside into the hallway where my mom and the doctor were talking.    

       “So when will we get the results?” My mom asked him. 

       “Tomorrow.” The doctor answered. My mom and I went to the waiting room. My mom signed some papers then we left. On our way home I didn’t say anything to my mom. My mom kept trying to talk to me though.

    “You’ve got to admit what you saw in the corner of the room wasn’t really there!” I didn’t talk. When we got home I went to my room and thought about what I saw this morning. It wasn’t making any sense. If that was my soul, why was it out of my body and why didn’t I feel any different? I wanted to do a test. So I walked over to the other side of my room and looked out the window. I saw a little tree my mom planted a couple years ago. 

      “I want that tree to die in twenty seconds.” So I started counting to twenty. “1-2-3-4” that’s when it felt like something pulled part of my skin off. My stomach was on fire. It hurt so bad. I thought that I was in one of those alien movies where the little monster rips out of the people’s chest. I turned and saw a shadow float out of my room. I ran after it. When I got to the hallway, I seen myself running but floating at the same time down the hall really fast. Honestly, I wasn’t sure if what I saw last night was really there, but now I know that what I was seeing was there. It went right through the wall. I kept counting to twenty, “5-6-7-8-9.” I was still chasing it. It floated into the kitchen. I stopped  “10- 11.” In between these numbers I was trying to get my moms attention. She was sitting in front of the TV in the living room. “12- 13- MOM! 14-15- MOM!” It opened up the cabinets under the sink and pulled out weed killer. It floated with the poison to the door. It tried to go through the door, but the weed killer wouldn’t go through. So it opened the door and went to the tree. “16-17-18 MOM!” 

     “What is it?” My mom turned around and looked at me with her, ‘I’m busy’ face.

     “Look! 19” It floated to the tree and poured the entire bottle of poison over the tree. “20” When my turned to look where I was looking, it was gone. I didn’t know where it went. 

     “Go to your room, and get some sleep. I know you didn’t get a lot last night.” My mom told me. I couldn’t move. I was in total shock about what had just happened. “I said go to your room!” My mom yelled at me. When I got to my room I saw it sitting on my bed like nothing had happened. It was just sitting there starring at me.

  

Chapter 7

     “What, I don’t get a thank you?” It asked. I didn’t say anything back. I could see right through it. It was weird. It was like he was a ghost. 

     “Th-Thank you?” I muttered.

     “I just did what you asked me to do, I killed the tree in twenty seconds, talk about good timing.” I didn’t say anything. “Don’t talk much do ya? Well, if you’re going to act like that, I should just go back to where I came from. It jumped up and shot into my belly. I flew backwards on my butt. I was in such shock I couldn’t think. I didn’t move either. My mom came into the room.

     “Who were you talking to?” I turned around to her. I could feel my head pounding and start to get heavy. Suddenly my eyelids fell shut. I had fainted.

When I woke up, I found myself lying on the couch with a wet cloth over my forehead and a doctor and my mom standing over me. I looked at the clock; 5:34 P.M. I had such a bad head ache. “Ah, what happened?” 

     “Oh, baby! We don’t know what happened to you.” My mom answered.

     “Wow!” The doctor started, “This is the second time we’ve got to see each other today. We’ll see again tomorrow too. We’ll find out what’s on your x-rays.”

     “How long have I been out?” I asked.

     “You’ve been lying on that couch for about 5 hours. We left you on your floor for about 2 hours.” The doctor replied.

     “Why did you leave me on my floor?”

     “We don’t know, we thought we didn’t want to wake you.” My mom answered.

     “Then why did you move me on the couch?”

     “Well, after we realized the back of your head was bleeding, we thought that we should get you onto a soft surface.” The doctor said. I felt the back of my head. I found a huge goose egg. “Yep, you hit the ground pretty hard buddy.”  

     “Don’t call me buddy.” I gave the doctor a dirty look

     “Okay champ.” I rolled my eyes and remembered what had happened right before I passed out. 

     “I saw myself again!”

     “Oh no! Not this again.” My mom whined as she threw her hand over her forehead. 

     “Now son,” The doctor began, “It’s all in your head.”

     “No! It’s real. I, I mean, it went to the kitchen got the poison out of under the sink and killed your tree.”

     “What!” My mom said as she ran outside. I could hear her scream. Then she ran back inside. “Why did you do this?” She yelled. I could see the vein start popping out of the top of her head.

     “It’s wasn’t me! It was my soul!” 

     “Shut up! You don’t have a soul,” Then she began to calm down, “I mean, you have a soul but it cannot come out of you body and kill my baby tree.”

     “Yes it can! And it can’t only kill trees! It can put dreams into other people.” I tried to defend myself.

     “Son,” the doctor started, “There is no way that it can put dreams into other people.”

     “It can’t only do that, it can kill people and it already has! A guy in Colorado.”  

    “Oh really, who?” The doctor asked. 

    “I just told you! The guy from Colorado!” I said.

    “But what’s his name?” My mom asked.

    “I don’t know, but it caused Chase’s dad to lose his new job.”

    “Ok,” The doctor said, “What’s that!” He blurted out pointing behind me. I was dumb enough to turn around. That’s when the doctor stuck me with a needle in my left butt cheek. About five seconds later, I passed out.                                                  

When I woke up I was on the couch again. I looked at the clock; 1:40 A.M. I was really tired. I looked around but I didn’t see anyone. Then I thought, duh! The doctor is probably at home and my mom is probably asleep. I got up, and walked to my bed. “Hey,” I said to myself, “I’ve only been awake for a few hours yesterday.” I really wanted to see my spirit again. So I had to say something for him to come out. 

“Show yourself spirit!” Hoping that is would come out. It didn’t. “Um… I want you to lie on my bed.” I waited, but nothing happened. Then I remembered when that last time I wanted him to come out, I gave him twenty second. “Okay, I want my spirit to come out of my body and lie down on my bed in 5 seconds.” 

Then I started counting. 1-2-3-4-5. nothing happened. How was I supposed to get it out? I was too tired to try anymore; I had to get to sleep. So I put my head down and went to sleep. 

    That next morning, I woke up and went to school. When I got there, Chase wasn’t sitting at his desk. I didn’t think that he could still be in trouble. I was about to get my stuff out of my backpack when I looked up and there stood Corey Jefferson. He was this kind of fat kid. You know how there is that one **really** fat kid that always stinks of B.O. Then there is that one kid that is really skinny and there cheeks go into there face really far. Well Corey was that kid in the middle, either way he was ugly. 

      “Um, hi?” I said to him confused to see him.

      “What did you do to Chase?”

      “Why do you care?”

      “Just wondering. So what did you do to him?”

      “Here, how about this. My spirit went to his house in the middle of the night and shot him with a gun. Then Chase woke up.”

      “Cool! What’s your spirits name?” What! What’s my spirits name? It’s Zach duh! I didn’t say that, but I was thinking it. 

      “Bob. It’s name is bob.” I said sarcastically. For some odd reason he believed me.

      “What’s the matter with you?”

      “What?” I asked.

      “You know, you’ve been acting different this week.”

      “This week! Monday I was only here until 1:30 and Tuesday I wasn’t here. And I just got here today.”

      “Yeah, but even right now, your usually so nice. Now your kind of grumpy.”

      “Okay, you wanna know why?” He shook his head yes. “Okay, I see my spirit everywhere When I tell my mom about it, she calls the doctor and the doctor shoves a needle up my butt cheek.”

      “I believe you!” Corey said. Actually, I was happy.

      “Okay, cool.”

      “Do you want to catch it?” He asked me.

      “Catch what?”

      “Your spirit. Do you want to catch your spirit?”

      “Do I want to… catch it my spirit? How am I supposed to catch it?”

      “I don’t know, but I’m sure we’ll figure out how.”

      “Really? You actually think we can catch something that can fly through walls.” I loved his enthusiasm.

      “We can get something that bob can’t fly out of.”

      “Who?”

      “Bob, the spirit! You know.” 

      “Zach, his name is Zach.” I looked at him like he was a retard. 

      “Why did you tell me it was bob?”

      “I was being sarc… what can’t a spirit fly through?” 

     “An electric force field.”

     “I don’t know where your getting your information, but where are we supposed to get an electric force field?”

      “Area 51?” 

      “Are you serious? Area 51! Nobody knows where area 51 is or if its even real!”

     “Couldn’t you ask your spirit to leave your body, go up to heaven and ask god?”

     “Excuse me! I can hardly get my spirit out of my body. I surely can’t get it to go to heaven and talk to god. There is probably a 100 year waiting list to talk to the big man!”

     “Well, we don’t have to ask god, maybe your spirit already knows where it is.”

    “You know what, I’m just more worried about getting it out of my body so I can talk to it.”

    “Okay.” That’s when I heard the bell ring. I got up and walked to the bathroom. I stood in front of the mirror and said, “Okay spirit. I want you to come out in twenty second.” I started counting, 1-2-3-4-5, that’s when a teacher came over to me and told me to get out of the bathroom because class has started. So I walked to my class and sat down.

    “Now class,” The teacher started when he was interrupted by me. I felt my skin start moving again. I knew my spirit was coming out. I was so happy. I get to see my spirit again and miss my least favorite class (I would miss the class because I would most likely be chasing my spirit). And then the spirit came out. 

    “Okay so what do you…” The spirit started when He looked around and noticed where he was. He was in front of the entire class. “Uh-oh.” He was floating up in the air. Then he shot back trying to get back in my body. I jumped out of my chair and he missed. I didn’t want him to get back in. The entire class was staring at him. Corey out of no where jumped up and dived for the spirit. He went right through and slammed into the wall, face first. 

     “I just want to talk!” I said. 

     “I don’t!” He replied as he shot towards me trying to get back in. I dived out of the way. I ran out of the classroom, making sure he wouldn’t get back inside. The spirit followed me. “Get back here!” He yelled.

     “No, I’m not going to let you get back inside me.” I looked back to see where the spirit was. He was gone. I knew he didn’t come back inside me, I would’ve felt it. I saw Corey come running out of the door.

     “Im coming!” He yelled. I looked all directions to find the spirit. I couldn’t. I looked away from Corey and I saw the spirit flying straight for me full speed. I fell to the ground. 

     “Corey duck!” I yelled.

     “What?” The spirit flew into his body. Corey flew back on his butt. “What just happened!”

     “Now don’t worry. But you have my soul inside of your body!” I didn’t know what his reaction would be. I stared at him, awaiting a response.

     “This is… SWEET!”

     “Okay we’ve got to get him out of you!” I told Corey. 

     “What do you suggest?” 

     “I say that we…” Then I was interrupted when the intercom came on.

     “Zachary Thompson, report to the office immediately.” I didn’t know why I would have to go to the office. So I started walking up the hallway to the office. When I got there I saw my mom and the doctor.

     “You might want to sit down.” The doctor said. I pulled up an empty chair. 

     “What’s going on here?” I asked.

     “Baby,” My mom began, “Your x-rays came back today and… well you have a twin brother.”

     “Are you serious.” I yelled with amazement, “Wait. How do you know that from my x- Oh my god he’s inside me!”

     “Yeah. You have your twin’s brother dead fetus inside you.” The doctor replied. I was shocked. We all sat there without saying anything and that’s when everything started coming together. My spirit isn’t inside Corey’s body, my twin brother’s spirit is in his body.

     “Can I go now?” I asked.

    “Well yes if you want to.” My mom answered. I jumped out of my chair and ran down the hallway back to where Corey is. He had already went back into the classroom. When I went inside to get him everyone was starring at me, including the teacher. I froze in the middle of everyone. 

    “Hey teacher, can me and Corey leave?” I asked. The teacher shook his head and clicked back in with reality. 

    “No, either way you’re still in this class.” I thought that if I got my twin’s spirit to come out, then I would be able to scare the teacher enough that I would be able to slip out of class. 

    “Spirit! I know who you are and I want you to come out here in 5 seconds. 1-2-3-4-5” My spirit didn’t come out. I wasn’t sure what the problem was. I didn’t know if he was stuck or what. Suddenly I began to hear sirens. I ran over to the window and saw an ambulance shaped car pull up. On the side it said ‘One way mental home’. I didn’t know what that meant, but I knew it couldn’t be good. I looked at my teacher.

    “I’m sorry.” He said. I couldn’t believe it. How could he? I looked back out the window and saw two men jump out and run inside.

    “Come on Corey.” I said grabbing him and pulling him out into the hallway. I was scared, I didn’t want to be put away. I ran up to the office hoping my mom would still be there. When I got there I found her.                                                                                   

    “Mom! They’re coming to take me away!”

    “I know.” I couldn’t believe it. Now my mom is against me. Then I saw the two men run in through the door. I started running the other way. Corey wasn’t far behind. I knew that any minute now I would be in custody. I was about to give up hope. Then a miracle happened. Corey screamed for help. I stopped, turned around and was trying to figure out what the problem was. I could tell he was in pain, but I knew why. My twin was coming out of his body. The two men stopped in shock. 

     “No one messes with my twin brother!” My twin yelled. He shot forward at the men. They ran the other way, from my twin. I didn’t know what to do. Run away and have a chance of losing my brother or stay and try and capture him. I would rather not get captured. So I ran the other way with Corey. We got to the end of the hallway where there where two double doors. We flew out them and into the forest right outside the school. We ran and ran for about five minutes. I probably never would’ve stopped except Corey had to rest. We were at least a half mile from the school. He sat down by a tree.

     “Where do you…” I took a deep breath, “Think my brother is?” 

     “Probably back at the school.” He answered. I wanted to go back there so bad to get him back, but he has lived in my body for 9 years (What I know of) he should be able to find me. 

     “Do you feel any different Corey?”

     “From what?” From what? A spirit just flew in and out of his body.

     “You know, a spirit just ripped out of your stomach.” 

     “Oh, I feel fine.” I wanted to talk to my spirit, but he would probably get scared and shoot back into my body. 

     “There’s one thing that I can’t figure out.”

     “What?” Corey asked.

     “If my twin brother’s spirit’s body is in my body, but his body is just a little fetus… why did he look like me?”

     “Maybe he came out of his fetus body and just lived in your body for a while.” Corey said.

     “I guess that’s feasible.” Suddenly Corey stood up and started walking off. “Whoa, where are you going?” I asked.

     “Home.” 

    “Home? You said that you were going to be here with me!”

     “When did I say that?”

     “Well it was kind of obvious when you ran out of the class room to help me catch my spirit.” 

     “Well I’m not just going to stay here in a forest.”

     “What if we got a room at a motel or something?”

     “I don’t have that kind of money!” Corey whined.

     “No, but my mom does.” So me and Corey ran out of the forest trying to make it back to my house. We ran out of the forest and down the highway. We watched as lots of cars passed us. 

    “Look at that car.” Corey said, “I like it.” He pointed to this car with a disgusting puke green color. I didn’t like it. As we watched all the cars go bye we saw a truck go down the road. The guy inside looked very suspicious. He had a nasty, brown beard going from one sideburn to the other. He had one lazy eye and one eye that was wide open. It looked like it was being held open. As we stared at him he looked back at us. He looked like he was twitching as he drove down the road passed us. All the sudden I felt that getting a motel is a bad idea. Finally we got to my house. There were two police cars in the driveway. I knew my mom was telling them that I was missing. Then my mom walked passed the window I was looking at.

    “Get back!” I yelled as I dove into my neighbors bush out in the front lawn. Corey looked around then dove into the bush with me. I peeked through the bush and saw my mom walk away, passed the window. I snuck over to her car where she keeps her purse, she always leaves it under the seat. I tried to open up the passenger door but it was locked. I looked back in the window and saw the keys lying on a table. I had to get in there somehow. I slowly walked over to the front door. I turned the door knob with caution. As the door began to open, I heard a creek noise. If mom my heard that she knew I was coming through the door. Once the door was open enough I snuck in. I tip toed over to the table. I looked around making sure my mom or police officers weren’t around. I grabbed the keys and flew out the door. I’m used to the bus almost missing me and I accidentally slammed the door out of habit. I didn’t wait to see what happens. I ran over to the car and unlocked it. I reached for my moms purse and pulled out a hundred dollars that she was going to spend on new clothes for herself. I looked back at the door and saw two police officers run out. I unlocked the passenger car door. 

     “Get over here” I yelled to Corey. I jumped in and sat down in the driver seat. Corey jumped in and I locked the doors. I couldn’t believe what I was doing. Luckily I still had the keys. I put the keys in the ignition and started the car. The police officer pulled out his night stick to bust the window. I put the car in reverse and shot backwards before the police officer could bust the window. I twisted the wheel around and was ready to start driving on the highway. I think I caused a couple wrecks behind me, but I really didn’t care. The police officers jumped in their police cars and turned on the sirens. I slammed on the gas. But I had forgotten to put the car in drive. I shot backwards and crashed into about five cars. I stepped on the brake and put the car in drive. But the police officers were right in front of me. I started moving forward and did a complete U- turn. So I drove away from the police cars. I was in total shock of what I was doing. I was completely bent over the stirring wheel. I looked over at Corey and he was more scared then I was. I looked in the mirror and saw the two police cars chasing us. 

      “Just stop the car!” Corey yelled.

      “I can’t! Do you really want to go to jail?” I knew that they wouldn’t send two little nine year olds to prison. I knew that we would be in a lot of trouble though.

      “If you stop now, maybe they will go easy on us!”

      “What! We stole a car, and my moms purse, we don’t have a license and on top of that I’m in fourth grade!” 

      “Just slowly let off the gas and step on the brake.” As we drove down the road, all the cars moved out of our way. I knew that after all this was over, I would be dead. I looked out of the sun roof and saw a helicopter over us. One side of the helicopter said ‘News channel 8’. I was afraid that they would find out who we are and blast it all over the news, then when we try and get a motel we can’t because the smelly guy in the booth have been watching the news. He gives us a room anyway to trick us, then he calls the police and they know exactly where we are. I am in my very first high speed car chase in my life with police officers and I’m only 9!

         “Maybe this motel isn’t a good idea.” I whined.

         “I’m thinking the same thing.” I was still stepping on the gas, going as fast as I can. I looked off to my right and I saw about ten sets of blue and red lights coming towards us. “I wonder what’s going on over there.” Corey said. I looked over at him like he was a retard. I saw an exit ramp, and I took it. I shot up the ramp and got on a road called N. Washington, but the police were hot on our tail. I looked over at Corey to see a tear go down his cheek. I knew that I had no right pulling him into this mess, but now that he is I think that I should try and calm his nerves. I turned on the radio to see what was on. As soon as I turned it on I heard a woman news person start talking.

      “I repeat, there are two nine year old boys who have hijacked a Ms. Thompson’s car. I am joined now by high in the sky John Frankerson. John?”

      “Well hi Kelly,” John said, “Yes, there are two nine year old boys in a red SUV ford. They are on North Washington road where there is a tipped semi truck about a half mile up. The police are pursuing the two boys and…” I turned off the radio. Me and Corey looked at each other then looked straight ahead.

      “AHHHH!” If I stopped then the police would get us and if I kept going we would get stuck behind a line of backed up cars. So I knew exactly what I had to do. “Buckle up.” I told Corey.

      “Ok.” He pulled the belt over his body and grabbed onto his arm rest as hard as he could. I looked to both sides of the car, wondering which way to go. One way there is a lake really far down and the other way there are a line of houses. I was about to make my decision when I heard two gun shots.

      “What’s that!” I asked Corey. He looked back.

     “They’re shooting at us!” He yelled.

     “Are they shooting at us, or our tires?” I asked.

     “Um, most likely our tires.” I didn’t know what would happen if they shot out our tires, so I didn’t want to take that chance. I turned left towards the lake. I could hear the car trying not to fall apart. I looked at the fuel.

     “Good news! We have almost full energy. See look.” I pointed at the E. The arrow was almost on the E. 

“If we wanted to, we could drive around all night.”

     “What’s the F stand for?” Corey asked.

     “Probably… I don’t know.” I looked up. The lake was coming at us fast. I tried to step on the brake but it wasn’t working. They must have shot the brakes. “Jump!” I yelled. I pressed the unlock button and jumped out of the door. I heard Corey scream as he jumped. I looked over at the car and saw it fly into the lake. I looked over and saw the police cars heading at us. “Run!” I yelled. I looked back at Corey and he was lying on the ground holding his knee. I could see the blood pouring out from under his hand. I only had a couple scratches and bruises, and maybe a broken wrist. But it wouldn’t keep me from running. I couldn’t leave him there, but I really didn’t want to go to jail. My brain said stay and help, but my legs weren’t listening. I took off running back into the nearby woods. I couldn’t believe what just happened. Why did I leave him there. I heard the police getting out of the cars and slamming the doors.

       I started crying. I couldn’t believe what I got myself into. I just kept running, and running. I knew it was a matter of time before the police would capture me and take me down town. It wouldn’t help to just keep running, I would have to find somewhere to hide. I ran over to a bush and got behind it. It was a crappy hiding place. I got up and ran over to a big mound of dirt. I hid behind it, but it didn’t help either. I finally found a little hole. Just big enough for me to fit into it. I was afraid that there might be a wolf or something in it though. I was going to take that risk. I jumped into it. Luckily I didn’t see any glowing eyes next to me. I pulled some leave and sticks that I could reach over my head. I closed my eyes and prayed.

       “God, if you can help me I promise that I will never be a bad kid again. I won’t steal my mom’s car 

again. Just please get me out of this. Amen.” I sat there sniffling and wiping the tears from my eyes. I could 

hear the police coming near me. I looked up through the brush and saw foot steps walk up to me. I was 

afraid that he would step down onto where I was hiding. I held my breath as I saw one step rise up. I was 

hoping that he was about to step backwards, but he didn’t. I saw the shadow cover my head and get bigger. 

His foot was about to smash my head. The sticks above started stabbing me in the head as he put his weight 

on his foot. I was getting really scared. Suddenly I heard a voice, It was Corey!

      “Let me go.” The sticks got off my head as the man walked away. I was so happy. I looked through the 

leaves to see a police car far away with Corey in it. Two police officers went over to him and the others moved forward to try and find me. As I sat in the dark, damp hole I felt something start crawling up my shirt. I knew that is was some sort of bug. Then I felt something crawl over the rip in my jeans. It was I spider. Suddenly something slimy started slide across my neck. I looked around for police officers, I didn’t see any. I knew that if I got out then they would find me because they will have to go back to their cars. So I sat there for about another two minutes. I could feel something crawl up my cheek. I didn’t know what it was though. I had about twenty bugs all over my body. Finally I found all the police officers walk back to their cars. I waited for them to drive away. That’s when I jumped out of the hole and shook my body to get everything off me. I saw about a billion ants fly off, a spider, a caterpillar and a snail. I looked up in the sky. It was getting dark, maybe about 8:00. I ran further and further into the forest. I never noticed how big it was. I started feeling sick. 

       After about a half hour I sat down on a rock and started crying. I was lost and scared. I didn’t know 

what kind of creatures came out at night. I didn’t know where my twin’s spirit was or what Corey is 

doing. I didn’t have a warm bed to sleep on or my books or any money… money! That’s when I 

remembered that I had taken a hundred bucks out of my moms purse. It does no good to me right now 

though because I’m lost. I don’t even know where a motel is. Suddenly I heard a gunshot. Who would be 

hunting at this hour of the night. Unless they’re hunting owls or bats or something.  I didn’t know if I 

should go to him for help, or if I should try and keep my distance. I would probably be a lot safer if I went 

to him for help. 

      “Hey, buddy! Can you help me?” I was sniffling a little while I talked. I saw him start running towards 

me. I didn’t know why he was running. I could’ve just walked over to him. I looked at him a little closer 

and noticed who he was. It was that guy I saw on the highway with the lazy eye. Now I wish I never called 

for help. “Hey, never mind, I can manage.” I yelled to him. That only made him run faster. Now I was 

really scared. I started running away from him. I looked back at him and he pointed his gun at me. I ran as 

fast as I could, but it was no use. He pulled the trigger. The bullet shot into my leg. My leg was completely 

drenched in blood. I just collapsed and fell to the ground. I caught myself with my hands. Except  I had already broken my wrist, it hurt a lot worse. I hollered in pain. The back of my hand was touching my arm. I looked back and saw the man coming closer and closer. He was right above me now. He reached down and picked me up. I fainted. 

I began to open my eyes very slowly. The light above me began to get brighter and into focus as my eyelids 

tore apart. I tried to wipe my eyes, but I couldn’t move my arms, they were tied behind my back. When I 

looked around, I noticed that I was in a small wooden chair. My feet were tied to the chair legs. I was in a 

small, grey and damp room. In the corner of the room, there was a door. The man wasn’t any where to be 

seen. I began to cry again, I couldn’t hold it in. Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in the back of my leg again. I 

screamed in pain. I looked down at my leg to see that it wasn’t wrapped or medicated. Where the bullet 

shot in, there was blood pouring out. Then I felt the pain in my wrist. I turned my head slightly to look at 

my wrist. It was brown and purple. It hurt so bad. I started hearing foot steps coming near the door. I saw a 

shadow peek in from under the door. The man threw the door open and stared at me with his right eye 

pierced open. I stared back at him with watery eyes. 

     “How was your sleep?” He asked in a scratchy voice. 

     “Why are you doing this?” I whined with a high voice. He walked over to me and came down to eye 

level. He was still staring at me without blinking. I didn’t know what to do so I spit. I spit straight in his 

eye. He jumped backwards and stood up as tall as he could. He started rubbing his eye and cursing words at 

me. Then he pulled out a knife and jumped forward towards me. He took the knife and shoved it into my 

thy. I started to cry even worse. I started wriggling in my chair. I tried to pull my hands out of the rope. I 

tugged and pulled. I was crying to bad to concentrate on what I was doing though. I could feel my heart 

start pumping harder and harder. I could feel my head start beating. I felt the adrenalin rush through my 

veins. My biceps started flexing by themselves. I could feel my eyes start popping out of their sockets. 

     The man started twisting the knife in my leg. The pain was too much, it felt like I was about to pass out 

again, but I didn’t. I didn’t because I felt a shed of hope in my grasp. My hands began to slip out of the 

ropes. The man started laughing because what he was doing to me. I knew if I pulled my hands as hard as I 

can they would slip out. There was one thing standing in my way. My wrist hurt so bad If I pulled any 

harder I might go into complete shock and pass out. That was a risk I was willing to take. I mean how bad 

could it hurt after everything I have already gone through. So I tugged and pulled, suddenly they ripped out. I threw my thumps at the man. Luckily I had long fingernails. I put my eight fingers on each side of his head and stabbed him into his eyes with my thumbs. He screamed and yelled. He jumped backwards screaming. I pulled the knife out of my leg and then untied my feet. I pushed the man back on his butt. I could hear him slam into the concrete. I tried to run, but the pain in my leg was too much; I just collapsed on the ground. I was losing a lot of blood. I ripped the sleeve off of my shirt and wrapped my leg. That’s when the man started screaming at me.

      “I might be blind; but luckily I know where everything in this house is.” He ran over to me and grabbed 

me by my throat. I started screaming and yelling for help, but no one answered. I didn’t know what to do. 

He was able to pick me up by my throat with one hand. He started running with me and then threw me on 

his bed. I wasn’t sure what he was about to do. I was praying that he wasn’t a pedophile. He ran over and 

grabbed a handful of rope. I tried to run off, except he ran back too fast. He took the rope and my hand and tied it to the fame of his bed. Then he did the same with the other. When he had to reach over my body to tie my other hand, I kicked him right in his… you know. He sucked in the pain and tied off my hand. I could tell that he could see a little bit. He grabbed some more rope and tied my feet off. He walks over to my face and asked me a question out of no where; “Have you ever seen a movie called _Misery_?” 

      “Yes!” I whined. I never wanted to see that movie because my mom said that it was scary, but when I went over to Chase’s house one time, we watched it. 

      “That’s good. That mean I won’t have to explain what hobbling means.” I was so scared, I started crying again. I saw him walk over to his closet and pull out a big block of wood. I started screaming and yelling for help. 

      Then I heard someone yell, “What’s wrong?” She started running towards the house. I was so 

happy. The man walked over to the door and held the block of wood like a bat. 

      “Don’t come in!” I screamed, “Just call the police!” I heard her pull out her cell phone and start dialing 

911. The man ran out of the door. I sat there scared to death of what might happen to the woman. I heard 

the block of wood hit something and it sounded like a head. I started crying once again. That’s when I 

knew that I was going to die. I started praying, “Please god, if you can hear me… please help me. I know I 

haven’t been the greatest Christian of all time but if you can help me I promise that I will praise your name 

everyday.” Suddenly I saw a person’s shadow walk towards the door. I saw one boot come in front of the 

door first, then another. When I looked up to see the body, it had too many curves to be the man. It was the 

woman. She did it! She ran inside and looked over me. She had blonde hair and tall purple boots. She was 

wearing a light red jacket that was unbuttoned. Underneath the jacket was a black _Dark Side of the Moon_ shirt. She was wearing ripped, light blue jeans. Her nose was perfect size. She had blue eyes, and red full lips. She starred at me.

      “Oh my god! What happened to your leg and your arm?” I had completely forgot about my wounds. 

She called back the police and asked for an ambulance. “How could anyone do this to a child?” She asked 

herself as she began to untie me. She ran back home as fast as she could. I was trying to figure out what she 

was doing. About two minutes later she came running back. That’s when I looked out the window and saw 

the man start to stand back up. I stood up and looked at the woman come into view through the window. I 

saw her lift up a hand held rifle and put it to the man’s head. I closed my eyes and shut my ears. I could still 

hear the gun shot though. Then she took me and laid me back onto the bed. She pulled up my pants leg 

where I was stabbed. She pulled out some peroxide. I remembered how bad that stuff hurt on an open wound. She put her hand over my eyes so I wouldn’t know what she was about to do. I started to cry once again even before she started to pour the peroxide. Today just hadn’t been my day. She started to pour it. At first I didn’t know that she started pouring it because my leg already felt really bad. That’s when I started hearing sirens come down the road. The ambulance pulled into the driveway. I remembered that I was wanted for hijacking my moms car. I really wanted to go to the hospital though. 

       Two guys from the ambulance put me on a stretcher and put me in the back of the ambulance. The 

woman got into the ambulance with me. 

      “Son, what is your mother and fathers name?” I sat there for a second and then answered. 

     “My dad is dead and my mom…” I didn’t want to answer it because I was afraid that she would find my 

mom and I would get into so much trouble. “And my mom is dead too. I’m an orphan.” 

      “Oh, poor baby.” She said as she hugged me. It took us about two minutes to get to the hospital.                   

I screamed and hollered. The pain was too much. The doctors rolled me into the operation room. They 

picked me up off the stretcher and put me on the operating table. My leg was in so much pain. I didn’t think 

I was going to live. I had know idea how much the infection had grown. When I looked at my leg, it was all 

the way up to my waist. The doctors started asking for 5 cc’s of morphine, whatever that is. The lights began to fade as my eyes fell shut. It felt like hours have gone by, then I woke up. I thought that the operation was over, but it wasn’t! It hadn’t even begun. I was only out of it for a few minutes. I could still feel the pain in my leg. I tried to scream, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t move or say anything. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I didn’t feel safe, I was sure I was going to die. I didn’t even know if they had gotten the bullet out of my leg yet. I looked down and saw all of the black and blue around where I was stabbed. I looked over at my wrist and saw that it was still swollen like a melon. I was scared to death because I still didn’t know what happened to my new best friend or my twin’s soul. I could see the doctor come near my leg with a kind of scoop object. He was about to take out the bullet. No one had noticed that my eyes were wide open. I felt the cold, metal utensil touch my leg. I tried to yell again but I couldn’t. The doctor lifted my leg up so he could see the bullet. He dug the scoop into my bullet wound. I was in so much pain, I wanted to pass out. I could feel the bullet moving around in my leg. I tried to kick, but my leg wouldn’t move. The doctor dug deeper and deeper into my leg. That’s when I noticed two doctors talking to each other in the corner of the room. 

  “We might have to amputate.” Said one of the doctors. After everything that had happened so far in the 

past week, that’s what I was scared of the most. Well, not really because when I jumped out of the car was 

pretty scary. Also when I was tied to a bed and I was about to be crippled. But out of everything, that was 

the third scariest thing that has happened to me. Suddenly I felt the bullet come out of my leg. I could hear 

it land into a little metal container. My leg was still black and blue from the stabbing and my wrist was still 

swollen from when I broke it. I saw the doctors staring at my leg, wondering what to do. A doctor rushed 

over to a cabinet and pulled out a two inch needle. The bottom of the needle was filled with some sort of 

liquid. The man rushed back over to my leg. I was terrified of what he was about to do. He laid the point of 

the needle right beside my kneecap. Then he started to insert the needle. I could feel it move under my knee 

and up into my thy. I tried to move again, but once again I couldn’t. He began to let the liquid flow into my 

sore. “If it doesn’t kick in soon,” the doctor started, “We’ll have to cut it off.” I screamed in terror. Nothing 

came out of my mouth again. That’s when another doctor walked over to my wrist. He took a needle too, 

filled with another liquid. I couldn’t stand the first shot, how would I be able to handle this one? The doctor 

shoved it into my wrist. I felt my wrist start to ache in pain even worse than it was before. The doctor 

inserted the liquid. He pulled the needle back out. “We have the X-rays back.” A doctor said, “It seems that 

he has a mild concussion.” Two doctors looked at my head. “My god, he’s awake!” A doctor screamed. I felt a sigh of relief in my throat. “Are you ok son?” One doctor asked. I just rolled my eyes around; that’s all I could do. I thought to myself, how could this guy ever become a doctor? No kidding I’m not ok! I have a leg that just got a bullet pulled out of it, had been stabbed and is on the verge of being amputated. The 

doctor put a gas mask on my mouth and put me back to sleep. I didn’t know how long I laid there, but when 

I woke up I was lying on a soft bed. I sat up and knew that the operation was over. I looked at my wrist first 

and saw that the swelling was going down. I was wearing one of the patient dresses without a back. I 

looked down at my leg. I didn’t have one! My leg was gone, where’s my leg. I thought about all the things that I will miss in my life. I won’t be able to do track, play on a basketball team, swim or play pro football.  I screamed as loud as I could. About thirty doctors ran in. 

      “I don’t have a leg! I don’t have a leg!” I yelled. 

      “Yes, we had to amputate it. And I have some bad news… we accidentally thought that your 

concussion was a brain tumor. So we opened up your head and took it out. But really it was your brain that 

we took out. We replaced it with an ape’s brain though.”

      “Oh my god!” 

     “Yes, but also the ape was dying of cancer, so your going to die in about 5 seconds.” Suddenly I woke 

up. It was all a dream. I was lying on one of those little beds though and I was wearing one of those 

dresses. I lifted up the dress part, and I did have my leg. I laid back in relief. Then I remembered the 

women who saved my life. I looked around the room and found her. She was sitting on a chair, filling out 

forms. I got up and walked over to her. 

     “How do you feel?” She asked me.

     “A lot better. My wrist hurts a little and my leg does too.” 

     “Well, the doctors said that, that should come back in about a week or two for a check-up.” 

     “I was awake!” I blurted out.

     “What?” She asked.

     “While they were doing the operation, I was awake. I guess the gas or something didn’t work and it 

didn’t put me out very long!”

      “Oh my god! Do the doctors know?”

     “Yeah, after I got two shots and a metal scoop shoved in the back of my leg.” 

     “I am so sorry. Did it hurt?”

     “Yeah. Really bad.” 

      “I’m just glad that your fine now.” She reached over and gave me a big hug.

     “Where am I going to live?” I asked the women out of no where.

     “Well didn’t you have an orphan or foster home?” I didn’t know what to say. If I said yes, then she 

would take me back there. If I said I didn’t she would get suspicious that I had no where to live all this 

time.

     “Um, I don’t.” 

     “Well where do you live.” There was the question I knew that she would ask. I don’t know. Now to put 

my creative story telling to come into action.

     “My dad had died about six months ago and I just lived with my mom for a while. Since my dad had the 

job, we lived off his income. He had only a little bit of retirement money and we lived off that for a while. 

Then we couldn’t afford the house so the government came and took it. That’s when me and my mom lived 

on the streets for a while. My mom went to Jackson county for a pack of cigarettes and never came back. That was about a week ago. Then I went to live on my own. I was walking down the highway and this guy threw me in his truck and took me to his house or something. You know the rest.” 

     “Jackson county? You mean Missouri?”  She asked.

    “Well yeah, where else would I say?” 

    “Do you even know what state your in?”

    “Missouri?”

     “We’re in Virginia.” Virginia! I’ll never see my twins soul again or Corey or my mom or… my mom! 

I forgot that I don’t like her. She was going to get me committed. I could start a new life here. I will never 

have to see my mom again. Where will I live though?

    “Do you want to come live with me?” She asked. Wow how convenient. 

   “Yeah!” 

  “Well, you ready to go.” That’s when I remembered that it must have cost a lot of money for my 

Operation. 

      “Yeah but did you pay for my operation?” 

     “Yep.”

     “How much was it.”

     “Let’s see, it was about $16,000.” I just smiled and looked at her. I sat there for a second.

     “No really.” I thought that she was joking.

    “I’m serious. Surgery is a lot.” I couldn’t believe that she would pay that much on me. Then I 

remembered the $100 dollars in my pocket. I reached down, but I couldn’t find it.

    “Where are my clothes?” I asked.

   “We don’t need those. There is blood and dirt and all sorts of other things in them.”

   “Yeah but I had some thing in the pockets.” I was starting to get worried.

   “I checked in the pockets, there was nothing in them.” Of course, that guy must have taken the money. 

  

    “What was in them?”

    “Nothing, that guy must’ve stolen it.”

   “Was it important?” She asked.

   “Only $100.” 

    “$100! How about we go to the police and tell them about it, ok.” 

   “Well, do I get any clothes for now?” I asked. 

   “Well of course.” Then she got up and went to a nurse. I didn’t hear what they said, but it was obvious.

She came back holding a pile of clothes. Probably not to sanitary because they weren’t mine, but I’ll it. I 

 Slipped the underwear on and took off the dress thing. “I don’t believe I caught your name.” The woman 

said.

     “My name is Zach, Zach Thompson. What’s yours?”

     “I’m Kendra.” We shook hands. 

I followed Kendra out to her car. I got into the passenger side of the car. Kendra started to drive away from 

the hospital. I kept wondering, how could that man have brought me all the way out here and why? 

      “What was your mom’s name?” Kendra asked. I thought of something really fast. 

      “Jenn… Jenn Thompson.” I was hoping that she wouldn’t ask anymore questions. I knew she would 

though.

      “Why was that man after you?” I was about to tell another lie but I didn’t have to. 

      “I don’t know. I was just walking through the woods and he shot me in the back of my leg.” 

      “I thought you said that you were walking down the highway and he pulled you into your car.” Uh-oh, I 

knew that I would get all mixed up on something. 

      “Sorry, my head is still a little messed up from jumping out of the car.”

      “Car? What car?” Crap.

      “Oh, I tried to jump out of the truck when he pulled me in.”

      “Ok.” So then we pulled up to her house, it was beautiful. It was big too. It had blue shingles and white 

walls. It looked like it had about three floors. The windows had a blue frame around them. They didn’t 

have a single neighbor around any where. That meant that they had a huge yard. I could only see the front 

yard and it was pretty big. There was a swing set outside, did she like to swing or does she have a child?  

We both got out of the car and started to walk inside. When I got on the porch I noticed that there was 

about five sets of chimes.

When the wind hit them, they sounded beautiful. Kendra opened the door and I walked into the 

living room. I looked around. The living room was all made out of wood. There was a rug below my feet 

that had a painting of a tiger. A glass cabinet in the corner of the room held blue and white chine. I walked 

into the dining room, she walked into the kitchen and started chopping carrots. I found a table that was 

already set. It all looked so beautiful. I noticed that the table was set for two. Had she gone home and got 

ready for my arrival when I was being operated on? 

     “Why is the table set for two?” I asked. She talked to me through a pathway that connected the kitchen 

and the dining room. 

    “Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t know that I was going to meet you earlier today and I only set it for me and my 

daughter.” Daughter! Yes, if she’s that beautiful, her daughter must be too. Kendra walked into the dining 

room holding a plate, fork and knife wrapped in a cloth napkin and a cup. She set it all down at a spot on 

the table. She pulled up a chair for me. I sat down. I looked up at the clock, 3:40.  “My daughter should be 

home in about 30 minutes. She will be very pleased to meet you.” I most likely will be very pleased to meet 

her. “So when’s your birthday?” Kendra asked. I though for a second.

     “It’s in two weeks.” I just remembered that it was in two weeks. 

     “How old are you turning? 18? 19?” I knew that she was joking.

     “I’m turning 10.” 

     “The big 1-0. Congratulations.” I was really happy to be in this house. I wasn’t sure if this was going to 

Be too personal, but I asked anyway.

     “So where is your husband?” 

     “Never had one.” Wait, if she never had a husband… how could she have a daughter unless she made a 

sin. That reminded me, I made a promise to god that I would praise his name everyday. So I laid my head 

down and put my hands together and started to praise.

    “God, thank you for everything! I really appreciate your help.” I wasn’t sure if that’s how you praise god’s name, but that’s how I’ll do it. About twenty minutes later Kendra walked in and put a big stew pot in the middle of the table. Then she came in with a clear bowl of mashed potatoes. Another with green beans and a plate with toast on it. I thought that it was a little early to be having dinner, but I was hungry. That’s when I heard a bus pull into the driveway. I looked out the window and saw a little girl come running to the house. I was so happy that I was about to meet the new Mrs. Thompson. I heard the door fly open and slam shut. The girl tossed her backpack onto the floor with a big grin. She was beautiful. She had a light jacket and wearing an under shirt that said hooters, the owls eyes were the two O’s. She was wearing ripped jeans at the bottom. It looked like she was wearing a lot of lipstick. She had light brown hair with highlights.  When she saw me, she looked at me in confusion.

      “Honey, this is Zach.” Kendra said. 

      “Zach?” I just smiled at her.

      “Did you adopt another kid?” She asked. Oh, that’s how she has a daughter. 

      “Zach, this is Sydney” Sydney came and sat down at the table. She sat down and smiled at me.

      “Hi Zach.” Sydney said.

      “Zach was kidnapped by some freak earlier today.” Sydney said.

      “I like him.” I was so happy, for once in my life everything was going great. 

      That week I would stay at home and Sydney would go to school. 

      “So where did you use to go to school?” Kendra asked.

      “Yeah, I went to school at…” I was afraid that if I told her where I went to school she would take me 

back to Missouri. Probably she wouldn’t drive me all the way out there but I wasn’t about to take that 

chance. “I don’t go to school.”

      “Well, I should get you enrolled in my daughters school, would you like that?” She gave me a big 

smile.

      “Yeah I would.” There was a big silence, so I decided to ask her something, “Why were you out by that 

house when I was screaming for help?” 

      “That man’s house was right by the bike path, and that’s where I run. It just so happened that I ran right 

past that house when you were yelling.”

      “Well, thanks a lot for saving my life and all. Hey,”

      “Yeah?” 

      “Why don’t you go to work?”

      “Oh I go to work, I just took this week off so I could take care of you.” I was curious how my leg was 

looking. I lifted up my pant leg and looked at where I was shot. I had a lot of stitches there. I looked right 

on top of my leg to see a even more stitches there where I was stabbed.

      “Remember that we’re going back to the doctors for a check up in about a week.” 

      “My birthday?” 

      “Oh that’s right, it’s your birthday next week.” I knew that she remembered because I had already found all the presents for me under her bed. I didn’t want to be a bad guest so I didn’t peek in them. This week had been great. I had almost forgotten about my twin. But there were times when I did think about him. There was a part of me who never wanted to see him again, I mean I have a good thing going here. Then there was the other part of me. I had so many questions for him. When I think of my twin, I think of Corey. I felt so bad about leaving him there. I should’ve ran over to him, picked him up, and threw him over my shoulder. Then I could run into the forest with him. Then again, if I did that he would have gotten kidnapped too by that freak. When I think of Corey, I think of my old best friend, Chase. I wish that we were still best friends. He would’ve ran with me through the forest, he would’ve fought though the pain. I wasn’t that worried about Chase anymore though, he’s probably sitting at home and watching TV. Corey is the one that is in Juvenile Hall. 

  I looked over my shoulder to see Kendra sitting on the couch, watching TV. Good Morning America 

was on. I was about to walk over and sit down by her when I heard Diane Sawyer start talking. 

       “We have amazing development in the Zach Thompson case. We have come to find out that this boy 

has not only hijacked his mom’s car, he had also KILLED one person, and is a suspect in the murder of 

Chase Monsdeoca! I was able to interview one of Zach’s friends and a culprit in the hijacking of Ms. 

Thompson’s car.”  I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Yeah I might have hijacked my moms car, but 

killed anyone. Wait… Chase is dead! Oh god. I didn’t do it! I never… My twin! He killed them. But why? 

I started walking backwards real slow like. Kendra leaned forward like she was interested. The TV 

switched over to Diane interviewing Corey. How do they know that he is my best friend? “So Corey, did 

you expect this from your best friend?” Diane asked.

     “Actually, yes. See Chase and Zach had gotten into a fight earlier that week. I didn’t want to see Zach 

kill chase, but you know. What do you do?” Corey kept talking but he was cut off. Diane was sitting at her 

desk again and suddenly a picture of me came on. 

     “So if you see this child, please call the police immediately. He is 4’8 and should be somewhere in 

Independence Missouri.” Kendra reached over and picked up her telephone. I decided to run out the door. I had to get away, far away. I looked back and saw Kendra running after me. I tried to run faster but I couldn’t. She caught up with me, dived and wrapped her hands around my feet. I fell to the ground. I didn’t want to go to juvenile hall or prison. 

     “Zach, come inside with me.” She looked mad. I was scared. I didn’t want to be mean to Kendra, but I 

had to I didn’t want to go to jail. I shoveled my hands underneath the earth. I picked up a handful of dirt 

and smeared it into Kendra’s face. I made sure that it got right in her eyes. I knew that I will hate myself for 

that. She threw her hands up and rubbed the dirt from her face. I stood up and ran off. I knew that it was 

just a matter of time before the police got here and took me away. I wouldn’t ever stop… ever. I had no idea where I was going to go, I have to go somewhere though. I will never run into the forest again. I will not get shot again or stabbed. I ran beside the road.  I knew that the police station was the other direction. So I kept running in the direction I was going. My legs started to get weak after about thirty minutes. I knew that I was about 1 mile away from the house. Suddenly I started to hear sirens coming towards me from behind. I had to get off the road. I turned right into open land. Far down the way, there was a farm. I 

decided I would settle there for awhile and the animals will keep me company. I didn’t stop running. I 

looked back and saw the police cars fly past me on the road. I was happy. I decided I could slow down 

now. I was really tired. The sirens started fading away, then they got louder again. They were coming back 

this way. I looked back and saw the cars stop right on the road in front of me. They slammed on there 

brakes and turned their wheel so that they would face me. They started driving towards me. Crap! I turned 

and kept running for the barn. Suddenly my shoe lace came unloose and under my other foot. I fell to the ground. The police stopped right behind where I was lying. It was over, it was all over. I closed my eyes and waited for them to throw me into the back of their police cars. They handcuffed my hands behind my back and put me in the back of the police cars. I felt a tear go down my cheek. I took one good look at the sunlight, I knew that in a few minutes I will never see it again. 

      I looked through the chain, separating me from the police, out the windshield to see Juvenile Hall 

closing in on me. I started hyperventilating. I could feel my heart beating in my head. I turned my head and 

saw a police car behind me with two police officers starring at me. I turned back the other way. The car 

smelt like urine and body odor. I had no idea who had sat here before me, I had a good feeling I didn’t want 

to meet them though. Suddenly the cops slammed on their brakes. I flew forward and slammed into the 

chain window. I knew that I would have an imprint there. I looked up and saw the passenger 

driver dead, stabbed in the back. The knife went through the back of the seat and into his back. The driver 

looked back at me, he must’ve thought that I did it some how. 

      “I didn’t do it, I swear!” I pleaded. The police officer pulled his gun out of his belt and put it against the 

chained window. I closed my eyes… BOOM! I wasn’t dead, I heard the gunshot though. I opened my eyes. 

The police officer holding the gun had a bullet in his head. The two police officers in the other car ran over 

to see what happened. They threw opened the police car doors and looked at the two police officers. They 

couldn’t believe what they were seeing, I could tell by there expressions. The two police officers pulled out 

their guns. Once again I closed my eyes. I waited a few seconds, then opened my eyes. The two men both 

sat with their jaws wide opened. I looked in the direction where they were starring. It was my twin! He was 

holding a gun in each hand, both pointed at the men. They pointed their guns now at my twin… BOOM, 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. Four shots fired. My twin didn’t budge. I’m not sure if they noticed that they 

could see through him yet. He just smiled and pulled the trigger. The two men went flying back onto the 

ground. I didn’t say anything. My twin grabbed the dead driver’s keys and opened the back doors. He 

unlocked my handcuffs and helped me up. 

      “Uh, thank you.” I muttered. 

      “Don’t mention it. So, how you’ve been?” I didn’t say anything. My twin always seemed to have an up 

beat attitude, even though I have only had a few encounters with him. 

    “Have you saw Corey?” I blurted out.

    “Corey? Corey? Corey! Is he that one fat kid that had bad breath?”

     “No that’s CJ Pile. I’m talking about Cory Jefferson.”

     “Doesn’t ring a bell.”

      “How did you find me?” I asked.

     “Well, you do have my un-grown fetus in your body. I can’t get lost from my body.”

     “Can we go get Corey?” I asked.

     “How do we know where he is?” I pointed towards the juvenile hall. My twin cleared his throat like he 

wanted to tell me something.

     “What?” I asked.

     “Corey was arrested in Missouri, right? 

      “Yeah.”

      “Do you really think that they would take Corey all the way over here to put him in Juvenile Hall?”

      “Your right. How about we go to Missouri.”

      “Well I can fly, how about you?” He asked. We both looked at the police car. “Lets go.” I walked over 

to the car and grabbed the dead driver. I put my collar over my mouth and nose. I pulled him out and threw 

him on the ground. My twin did the same with the guy in the passenger seat. 

     “Why didn’t we just go in the car without dead people in it?” I asked. 

     “I dunno.” I noticed that I was wasting a lot of time chatting and we should already be on the road. 

Three police cars pulled out of the building. They must’ve been expecting us and when we didn’t show up, 

they got suspicious. I jumped in the car and my twin got in the passenger seat. I looked around for the keys, 

I couldn’t find them. The other police were coming close. I looked down under the gas pedal and found them. I put them in the ignition and started the car. The cars were about 100 feet away. I put the police car in reverse. Then I remembered the car behind us. I slammed into the car.

     “Ah, son of a…” I screamed when my twin interrupted me.

     “Come on!” He flew out of the top of the car. He came around to my door and threw it open. He pulled 

me out and started hovering with me in his arms. I could tell he was having a lot of trouble trying to hold 

me up. He started shooting down the road with me. I suddenly started hallucinating. I was thinking about everything that had happened to me in the last two weeks. I got stabbed and shot in the leg, crashed a car into a lake and my best friend was killed. He killed Chase. I was getting really mad, but I didn’t want him to drop me. We were going twice as fast as any police car. I wonder how fast he would be going if he wasn’t carrying me.

       I looked back at the police cars. They were getting smaller and smaller. I looked up at my twin. He 

looked happy (for some reason). 

     “Pull off the road.” I told him. He turned off the road and headed for the forest. “No!” I screamed.

     “Why not?” He asked.

      “I’ll tell you later. So he turned around and headed the other way. I just noticed that we were headed 

for the farm I wanted to go to earlier. It only took about 20 seconds to get down there. He set me down on the ground and we walked into the barn. I threw the doors opened, but he went through the wall. 

       “Hey! What do you want?” a voice said behind me. I looked around to see who said it. I found who it was. It was an old man feeding his pigs. He looked like a sweet old man who was at the peek of his life. I looked over at my twin for him to say something, but he didn’t. He picked up a pitchfork stabbed in a pile of hay. He threw it forward at the man. It pierced him through his stomach.

       “No!” I screamed. I ran over to the old man to see if he was alright. He wasn’t, he was bleeding 

profusely. 

       “Tell my daughter, I’m sorry I didn’t get to see my grandchild be born.” He laid his head back on my 

arm. He was dead.             

      “Why did you kill him?” I asked in concern.

      “Who cares.”

      “He had a daughter, and he was going to be a grandpa!” That’s when I remembered about Chase. “How could you kill Chase.”

      “I was getting revenge, okay!”

      “If I wanted revenge, I could’ve done it!”

      “I wasn’t doing it for you, it was for me.” I looked at him puzzled.

      “What did Chase do to you?” I asked. 

      “See when he beat you up, I was also in your body, and I could feel every blow!”

      “You can feel pain?” I was surprised. 

      “No, I can’t feel pain out of your body, but inside I can.” 

      “Why?” 

     “When you punch the fetus, I can feel it. Just like when some one punches your body.” I was beginning 

to get curious. I knew this would most likely hurt, but I would fight through the pain. I punched myself as 

hard as I could into my stomach. I looked at my twin. “Owe!” He yelled. I just smiled at him. He gave me a 

dirty look. 

     “What’s it like inside my body?” 

      “Well it’s really dirty, and you have a twenty long tape worm chewing on your kidneys.”

     “What!”

      “No, I’m just Josh’n you.” I took a sigh in relief. 

     “What are you going to do about Chase and Corey?” I asked.

     “Chase, I can do nothing. I can got Corey out of Jail though.”

     “What will you do about Chase though?”

     “I can’t do anything. I’m not able to bring him back from the dead. Well…”

    “Well what?” I whined.

    “No, never mind.”

    “No, what?” I pleaded.

    “Well, dad has a machine at his work that allows him to work on dead bodies. Maybe even bring them to 

life.” I jumped up and pointed at him.

    “Lair! First off dad is dead, second off there is nothing that will ever bring someone back from the dead.”

    “Actually, as far as I know he is alive. And when he made us he was working on a machine.”

    “Made us? What! My dad is dead, and where would he be working on this machine? At Quick trip? 

Where do you get your information?” 

     “It’s our dad, not just yours. And when you are born, you have all of the information of your mother and 

your father. Dad’s information was interesting. He…”

     “Hang on,” I interrupted him, “If when your born, you have the information of mom and dad… why 

don’t I know this?” 

    “Because after about 2 minutes, you forget. But since I never grew past 2 minutes I never forgot.”

    “Another question. Why didn’t the doctor never see you in my body before?”

     “I was too small before, but since your stomach is connected to my body, I grew as you eat.”

     “Why are you alive? Shouldn’t you be in heaven or something?”

     “Well no. For some odd reason my DNA got mixed up with yours, and my spirit just lived in your body 

with your spirit. I will never go up into heaven or anything until you die.”  

    “Oh.”

    “Anyway, as I was saying before. Dad worked on an invention that makes people come to life or 

something like that. Your dad worked at Area 51 and he…”

    “Area 51! Your kidding.” I yelled.

    “Shut up! Let me finish my story.”

    “Do you know where Area 51 is?” 

    “Duh!”

    “Wait, why did my mom say that dad was dead? She’s a liar!”

    “No she isn’t. She thought that he was dead. Have you ever saw the movie Men in Black?”

    “Uh-huh.”

    “Well you know how they made up that story that Tommy Lee Jones’s character was in a coma?”

    “Yeah.”

    “It’s basically the same thing except they thought that it would be easier to say he was dead.”

    “Ok. Can we go to Area 51?”

    “I guess, if you really want to. But you won’t be able to get in.”

    “I’ll figure out a way.”

   “Well let’s go then.” So me and my twin both stood up and were about to walk out the door when I 

stopped.

    “We need to go get Corey first.” I said.

    “Why?”

    “Cause he really wanted to go to Area 51.”

    “Fine, we’ll get him first, then go to Area 51.” So me and my twin were about to walk out of the barn, 

except we started hearing sirens again. They must be going back to the jail. But they weren’t, they started 

coming towards the barn. 

    “What do we do?” I whined.  

     “Hide.” My twin ordered me. I ran over to the pile of hay and hid behind it. I sat down and cuddled into 

the fetal position. My twin just walked right through the door and slammed it shut behind him. I stared out 

a low window. I could hear the police cars come to a screeching halt in front of the barn. My twin walked 

over a police car as all the police officers got out with guns drawn. My twin jumped into one of the police 

officer’s body. I didn’t know what he was doing. Suddenly the police officer that he went into pulled out 

his gun. I knew that my twin was controlling him, I didn’t even know he could do that though. He started 

open fire on the other police officers. Each one fell to the ground, one by one. I had to close my eyes again. 

I could still hear every gun shot.

      “Bang, Bang, Bang.” I thought that it was over. So I opened my eyes. My twin (in the police officer’s 

body) put the gun to his head. He pulled the trigger. Blood went everywhere. I closed my eyes again. My 

twin started walking back to the barn. He got half way through the way then stopped, he was stuck. His hand was on the outside of the door. He went back outside and opened 

the barn door. He was holding. Two guns. He threw one to me.

       “You’ll need that.”

  

      “Wait a second!” I yelled.

      “What?” My twin asked.

      “We’re not about to walk all the way to Missouri? Unless you want to carry me some more.”

      “No I don’t want to carry you anymore, so let’s just take this police car.”

      “No way, you remember what happened last time I tried to get behind the wheel of a car.”

      “I know. That’s why I’m going to drive.” So my twin got in the driver side of the car and I got in the 

passenger. He put the key into the ignition and we were off.

      “What’s your name?” I asked.

      “Same as yours, unless you want to give me a different name.” 

      “Sure. You can be called Mr. Wiggles.”

      “Get out!” My twin pointed for the door.

      “Okay, okay. Your name can be… Alexander.”

      “No.”

     “Okay, this is a working progress. This is why we have these confrontations. You can be… um… uh… 

your name can be Happy.” My twin took the wheel of the car and twisted it. My head went flying and 

rammed into my window. “Owe! You idiot. Just say you don’t like it.” My twin got back on the road. “You 

can be… I don’t know.”

      “Ok, I’ll name me. I want to be called Jamal.” 

      “Jamal? What are you talking about?”

      “I like the name Jamal.”

      “Whatever.” Jamal slammed on the gas and we shot down the road. “Turn on the sirens.” I told Jamal. 

So Jamal reached over and pressed a button on the dash board.

       “Why turn on the sirens?” Jamal asked.

       “You know, incase there is a red light, we can fly right through it.” 

     “Do you even know where the Juvenile Hall is in Independence?” Jamal asked.

     “No, I was hoping you did.” 

    “Why would I know this?” 

    “Crap, now we’ll never get Corey out.” 

     “We don’t have to get him, we could go straight to Area 51.”

     “Yeah but he really wanted to go.” I said.

     “Well, what do you suggest we do?” 

     “Go get him!” 

     “I know that we need to go get him but how?”

     “Oh. We can go ask someone where it is.”

     “Yeah, a nine year old boy and his twin brother who which you can see through drives up to someone 

on the street in a police car and asks where Juvenile Hall is.” 

     “Okay, okay. How about we get a map.” 

     “Do you have any money to buy a map?”

     “No, but can’t you steal one?”

     “You mean brake the law? Shame on you.” 

     “Your worried about braking the law.” I didn’t realize he was being sarcastic.

     “Okay. Let’s find a store. Where would they sell a map?”

     “The air port?” I suggested.

     “Okay, well where’s the airport?” 

     “Uh… I don’t know.”

     “I have an idea.”

     “What?”

     “What if we stole a map out of someone’s car, like someone who is visiting Virginia on a family 

vacation.” 

     “I like it! But where would we find someone?” That’s when a car drove past us. There was a man 

wearing a Hawaiian shirt, and there was a women wearing big sun glasses. There was also three kids in 

back fighting.

      “Speak of the devil!” Jamal made a complete U-turn and started following the car. The car pulled over 

to the side of the road. I was wondering why they pulled over. We had our sirens on, of course. They 

weren’t about to listen to two nine year old boys. 

     “Let me do it.” I said. “They’ll get freaked out at a see through kid.” 

      “No, no. I can do it. Wait here.” So Jamal went through the door and over to the van ahead. I couldn’t 

really see what was happening, but Jamal came back with the map. It only took him a couple seconds. 

Jamal threw open the door and stepped inside. “Ok, let’s go.” Jamal drove off the shoulder and past the 

van. I looked over at it and there sat the dad, the mom, and the three kids all shaken up. I knew that Jamal 

just scared them to death.

      “Hey Jamal,”

     “Yeah?”

     “Why is it that you didn’t come out of my body until about a month ago?”

     “Because, I didn’t know that I could come out of you until about a month ago. It is very complicated.”

     “Why is it that on the security cameras, they thought that it was me instead of you who killed that guy in 

Colorado?”   

      “You serious? I look exactly like you and no one else know I exist, except Corey.”

      “Yeah but they can see through you. It seems like on camera they would be able to see through you 

too.”

     “Do you know how crappy those security cameras are? They could probably barely make out my face.” 

     “Oh.” Jamal then handed me the map.

     “Figure out where we’re going.” So I looked at the map.

     “Go left up here on this road.” So Jamal went forward about 100 feet then turned left. “Now get up on 

the highway.” I looked around for the highway, but couldn’t see it. There was nothing anywhere. It looked 

like desert land everywhere. No trees or anything. I knew that the highway was about a couple miles ahead, 

and by then we should start seeing some more people and buildings. I started getting a little warm. I leaned 

forward and cranked up the AC some more. I looked over at the gas gage, it was on F. “Uh-oh. We’re 

almost out of gas.”

      “What, we have plenty of gas.”

     “No. It’s supposed to be on E.”

     “What? Trust me, we have plenty of gas.” I decided to believe him. After about 5 minutes we got to the 

highway. There was finally a lot more cars and stuff on the road. We had the sirens on still, so we were able 

to go as fast as we wanted and everybody just got out of our way. 

     “What’s Area 51 like?” I asked.

     “Hmm?”

     “Area 51, what’s there?”

     “Oh. I don’t want to spoil the surprise.”

     “Don’t worry, you wont spoil it.”

     “Okay. Well, at Area 51 there is a l…” Jamal was interrupted by the police radio coming on. 

     “There is a gang on Highway 85 and Vista. All units report immediately.” We didn’t pay much attention 

to it. I turned it off and I wanted to listen to more of Jamal’s story. It wasn’t going to last though. I looked 

up and noticed that I was on Highway 85. I heard some more sirens up ahead. I looked as far up the road as 

I could. There was a sign that said Vista. 

      “Stop!” I yelled. By the time Jamal slammed on the break, we were in the path of a gun. There was a 

man who was holding a gun straight towards me.

      “Get out of the car, I’m gonna kill you!” The man yelled. Crap!

      “I told yo, get outta da ca.” The man said, still with his gun pointed at me. “Wait a minute? Yo just 

kids.” He turned around and looked at the other guys in his gang. There were abut five men with bandanas 

surrounding him. They all had their hands holding their pants up. “Either way, get outta da ca! Both ya!” 

Am I the only one here who can see through Jamal? I stepped out of the car with my hands up in the air. 

Jamal just sat there. I knew that he wasn’t about to get out, what did he have to lose. Suddenly, I don’t know what it was, but something clicked in his head that he was in trouble somehow. I could tell because his eyes shot wide open and his back went straight. That’s when about three cop cars came into view. The leader of the gang ran over to me and wrapped his arm around my neck, and a gun to my head. The cop cars came to a screeching stop on all sides of us. The cops threw the doors open and pointed guns at all the men. They put the guns right above the window of the door, and they stood behind the door. 

      “Put the guns away, or I’ll shoot’m!” The police officers slowly put down their weapons. I looked over 

at a police officer who was giving me a big stare. 

      “It’s Zach! It’s Zach Thompson.” The police officer yelled.

     “Who?” The other cops asked.

     “The murderer, the one the chief told us to watch out for! Open fire!” Oh god I was about to die. But luckily Jamal flew out the top of the car and everyone’s attention went on him. It was my chance to get away. I took a big bite into the man’s arm who was holding me. He moved his arm and I ran back to our car. The man I bit started to open fire at me. I jumped into the car through the open window. The police officers started to shoot the man who tried to kill me. That’s when the other members of the gang started Trying to shoot the police, they shot back at them.

      “Come on let’s go!” I yelled to Jamal. Jamal flew back down through the roof and shot forward right at 

the gang. I got down under the dash board. That’s when the gang and the police started to shoot at Jamal. 

They shot out our windshield and all of our windows. I looked up at Jamal. Bullets kept shooting right 

through his body and head. I tried to stay as far down as possible. I felt my side of the car go up like we ran 

over something, or someone. Most likely a person in the gang. That didn’t stop Jamal though, he kept 

going. I heard a few car doors slam shut and I knew that the police were about to start following us. I got up 

onto my seat and didn’t say anything. I looked over at Jamal, he was smiling, he didn’t have any care at all. 

I looked straight ahead down the road. I looked as far as I could, there was a river up ahead. 

     “I have an idea.” I said. The police weren’t far away from us. I turned on our sirens so people would get out of our way. The bridge was getting closer to us. Jamal slammed his foot on the gas and we went flying. I could hear gun shots behind me. The cops must be shooting at us. I knew that we only had to wait about twenty seconds until we got over the bridge. I slowly slipped off my seat belt. Jamal looked over at me trying to figure out what I was doing. Closer and closer the bridge got. Suddenly our back window was shot out. Ten more seconds. I reached over and put my hand on the stirring wheel. 

      “Hey, what are you doing.”

      “five seconds.” I muttered. I closed my eyes and looked over at Jamal.

      “What? What’s that look?” For some reason Jamal looked scared. We were finally over the water. The 

river was about 30 feet down. The police were about 3 seconds away. I looked at the end of the bridge to 

see four cop cars, they made a road block. I knew that I had to do it now. I twisted the wheel as far over as I 

could. We were flying over the edge of the bridge. “Hey! What’s the matter with you!” Jamal yelled as we 

started flying down. 

      “Now!” I jumped out of the window and Jamal went through the back of the car. I was falling fast, I 

hoped Jamal knew what to do. I closed my eyes as I felt the wind go past my face. The wind went up my 

shorts and through my shirt. I was wondering where Jamal was. Suddenly the wind stopped going up my 

shorts. Instead it started flying right at my face. I was flying forward instead of down. I opened my eyes 

and looked up to see Jamal holding onto me. We were flying over the river at about 50 miles per hour. 

Jamal could fly fast. At first I thought that I was about to die. I looked through Jamal and up on the bridge. 

The police officers were still in awe about what they were seeing. Backwards and down at the river. The 

water was still splashing from the car slamming into the river. I looked ahead to see where we were going. I 

looked on both my sides to see land, but that’s not where we were heading. We kept following the river.

     “Where are we going?”

     “Shut up!” Jamal yelled. I was confused why he was so mad. I mean he just saved my life. I mean its not 

like he was going to die or anything, unless… of course. If I died he would’ve died to. I looked back up at

him, he looked flustered. I was waiting for him to stop somewhere. He wasn’t going to though. I tried to 

entertain myself somehow, but I couldn’t figure out how to when I was twenty feet above water. After 

about five minutes of flying, I knew that we were a good distance away from the cops. 

     “So you think that we could…”

     “Shut up!” Talk about holding a grudge. So I looked around at all the sights, there wasn’t that much to 

look at though. I looked up at Jamal, he looked tired. Finally he flew over to the bank of the river and sat 

down. I walked over and went behind a tree, I had to pee so bad. Looking at all that water for five 

minutes… self explanatory. Jamal just sat down and stared at the water. He looked kind of sad. When I was 

done I walked over to him to see what was wrong. 

      “So, what’s up?”

      “You could’ve killed me!” Jamal yelled.

      “What? How?”

      “My fetus is inside of you remember? If you drowned, I could’ve drowned to.”

      “I have a question for you.”

      “What?” Jamal seemed really angry still.

      “How come you can walk through things, but still you can hold things?”

      “I don’t know. I can control what part of me turns into a solid and what doesn’t.”

      “How come you can fly?”

      “I don’t know! Leave me alone!” 

      “Fine.” I walked away. I began to look around to see what was around. Luckily there wasn’t any forest anywhere. I looked up at the sky. The sun started setting. It was probably like 7:00. I started to look for somewhere I could sleep. I grabbed some tree limbs and tried to make a shelter. I stood all of the branches up like a teepee. It was too small though. “Hey,” I yelled back to Jamal. 

     “What?”

      “Where are you going to sleep tonight?”

      “It depends.”

     “Depends on what?”

     “Well, I’ll be probably be sleeping in your body tonight, so really I’ll be sleeping where ever you sleep.”

     “Okay.” So instead of trying to make a shelter, I would probably just lay down on the bank by the river. 

I walked over to where Jamal was an laid down. I laid there for about thirty minutes until the sun went 

down. Jamal and I just sat there talking.

     “What’s it like to have friends?” Jamal asked. This was I think the first time Jamal asked me a question.

     “Um… uh… its uh cool, I guess.”

     “I wish I had some.”

     “You could get some. I mean, its not that hard.”

     “Yeah it is.”

     “What?”

     “I can read your mind, I know that you only had Chase, but after he was kill you only had Corey. To bad 

he’s in Jail.”

     “You can read my mind?”

     “Yeah.”

      “You’re a pervert!” 

      “I wouldn’t be calling me the pervert.” 

     “How do you control people?”

     “I don’t know. I just get into there head, switch some things around and connect them to me.”

     “Have you ever controlled me?”

     “No, I can’t.” Jamal seemed disappointed.

     “How come?”

     “I can’t control you because when I go into your body I go straight to my fetus.”

     “Why?”

     “I don’t have all the answers okay. Anyway, how do you know I can control people?”

    “Cause you controlled that police officer, you know when we were back in the barn?”

    “I’m not following.”

    “Oh well. Another question…”

      “Yeah.”

      “Why is it that when I still lived at my house, I had a dream about killing Chase’s dad?”

      “I just wanted to mess with you.”

      “Yeah, but how could you have made Corey’s dad have the same dream at the same time?”

      “I’m good like that.”

      “No seriously.”

     “Okay. He didn’t have the dream at the same time, after I gave you the dream, I gave it to Corey’s dad. I 

can move really fast when I’m not carrying someone.”

     “What about when you went to go kill that guy in Colorado, why didn’t I have the dream about you 

killing him?” 

     “I had to get to Colorado.”

     “How did you know which guy you had to kill in Colorado?” 

     “I read Corey’s dad’s mind. In his head he told me exactly what I could do so he wouldn’t move.”

     “Ok. Why do you keep doing what I say?”

    “Cause I want to be a good brother duh.” I could tell by his face that, that was a load of garbage. There 

was something that he wasn’t telling me. 

     “Why did it use to rain  when you were about to kill someone?”

     “What?”

     “You, know. It used to rain when you were about to kill someone.”

     “Oh, I don’t really remember but ok.”

      “Well…”

      “Well… what?”

      “Why did it rain?” 

      “It was probably just a coincidence.” I went a long with it. I looked up at the sky to see stars start 

popping up. 

     I tried to get comfortable because I was getting tired. I closed my eyes and started dozing off, but Jamal 

started talking to me again. 

     “Do you like Sydney?”

     “Hmm?” I didn’t open my eyes.

     “Sydney, you know that girl that you lived with for a while.”

     “Actually, I like her mom better. And stop reading my mind!”

     “I didn’t have to read your mind to know that.”

     “But you’ve never saw Sydney before.”

    “Okay, so I read your mind. Don’t kill me.”

    “Let’s get some sleep, okay.” So Jamal flew up in the air and shot down into my body. I closed my eyes  

and fell fast asleep.

  

      That next morning I woke up and opened my eyes only to see leaves, sticks and dirt covering my body. 

I brushed off all the brush and sat up. I looked around. “Hey Jamal.” No reply. I hit my stomach lightly, 

nothing. Where is he, and why did I have all this stuff on me. I looked ahead to see if Jamal had ran off 

somewhere. I turned around and looked at the river. I couldn’t see anything. I looked up at the bay across 

the river. There sat four police cars. I felt a sudden urge to run. That’s when I noticed that there was no one 

inside the police cars. I turned back around to see if I could see anyone. I saw a small shadow flying 

towards me. It was Jamal. As he got closer he gave me the signal to get down. I tried to cover myself with 

all the sticks and leaves, but I couldn’t get all of them over me. I looked through Jamal to see about eight 

police officers running after Jamal. I didn’t have enough time so I didn’t even think. I turned and jumped 

into the river. It was about 8:00 in the morning so the water was really cold. I was freezing. I wrapped my 

arms around my body to keep warm. I started swimming down lower into the river so the police officers 

wouldn’t see me. I looked up through the top of the river to see Jamal fly over the river to the bank on the 

other side. The police officers opened fire from the other side of the river. I started running out of breath. I 

can’t hold my breath that long underwater. I get nervous and scared. I couldn’t come up yet or else I would 

be shot. I felt my lungs getting heavier and heavier. I had to come up now or I will die. So I burst up to the 

surface of the water. I busted through the top taking a deep breath.

       “Crap!” Jamal yelled diving towards me. The cops didn’t know what to think, were they seeing double 

or what. Jamal picked me up out of the water and we flew up into the sky. The police pointed their guns at 

us and pulled the trigger. Bullets shot by me and Jamal but never hitting us. Me and Jamal were flying 

down by the river. It only took about five seconds and they couldn’t see us anymore. We weren’t about to 

stop. 

    “What just happened?” I asked.

     “The police found us somehow. I heard the sirens heading towards us so I decided I would save your 

life. I shot out of your body and covered you with stuff so that the police wouldn’t be able to see you. I ran 

through the valley, not fly, ran. I ran so it would look like I was human. The police chased me into the 

valley. After about three minutes I started heading back towards the river, only to see you waking up. You 

know what happened next.”

     “Oh, thanks.”

     “Don’t mention it.”

     “So, where are we going.”

     “Back to Missouri to get Corey.”

     “But we don’t have the map. How will we know how to get there?”

     “It can’t be that hard to find it.”  

     “Yes it will.”

     “After we get to somewhere, we’ll ask someone okay.”

     “Oh yeah, I’m sure that everyone will know exactly where Juvenile hall is in another state.”

     “Let’s do what you said. Let’s go to the airport and get a map.”

     “Where’s the airport?” I asked.

     “Well if we find a plane, we can go the opposite direction where it’s going and we will come to the 

airport.”

     “What if it’s going to the airport?”

     “We’ll figure it out eventually.” 

     “Okay.” So Jamal and I looked up in the sky for a plane. We looked… and looked… and looked. 

Nothing. No plane’s anywhere. I didn’t know what Virginia is like, but it seems like there would be some 

sort of plane somewhere. We kept looking, but then we got bored so Jamal went over to the side of the river 

and put me down on the ground. I sat down and hung my feet over the river. I looked to both of my sides, I 

didn’t see anyone anywhere. “How, about we just go straight to Missouri, we’ll figure it out when we get 

there.

      “Here’s a better idea. Lets blow off Corey and go to Area 51.” 

     “No! He really wanted to go, so we’ll go get him!”

     “Kay.” So Jamal walked over to me, picked me up and hovered for a second. Then he put me back down 

on the ground. 

     “What? What’s the matter?”

     “I don’t want to fly anymore. Can’t we kill someone and steal their car?”

     “Do you have any conscience what so ever?”

     “No, you took my conscience. That means you have a double dose. That is why you feel bad when I kill 

someone.”

      “No, everyone feels bad when you kill someone.”

      “Well that is why you feel bad when you fall and scrape your knee.”

      “That’s not conscience, that is pain. You don’t feel it because your only a spirit.”

      “Oh, well that is why you feel bad when you kill a spider.”

      “I do not!” 

      “Let’s just go get a car.” So Jamal and I walked away from the river and walked to the road. I looked in 

both directions, no cars. This obviously isn’t a very busy city.

      “Just pick me up and lets just fly.”

     “No! We’ll find a car.” So Jamal and I started walking down the road, looking both directions for a car. 

We looked… and looked… and looked. Nothing. No cars anywhere. 

  

      “Okay! What’s going on here? No cars, no planes, what is up with this. Where is everyone?” I asked. 

That’s when suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my side. It felt like I was about to throw up. “Oh man!” I screamed.

      “What? What’s wrong?”

      “I’m sick, I’m going to throw up.” I ran behind a tree and let it all come out. My face started sweating, 

my hands were all clammy and my stomach was about to come out of my mouth it felt like.  

       “What’s wrong with you?” Jamal asked. I couldn’t answer, I just threw up. It splattered all over my 

shoes. I could feel the chunks of food roll down my chin and onto my shirt. My knees began to wobble, 

then suddenly they collapsed. My body slammed into the puddle of puke. The smell was horrible. My throat was burning from all the acids that came up from my stomach. I turned back onto my back. I laid there for a few seconds; I started puking some more. I couldn’t turn back onto my stomach. I was going to drown to death if Jamal didn’t do anything. Luckily he did. He ran over to me and picked up. He held me up so I wouldn’t die. I looked back at Jamal, we suddenly started hovering above the ground. My fingers began to tingle. You know that feeling like when you wake up and you realize that you’ve been sleeping on your arm all night and that annoying tingly feeling starts. I grasped my stomach and closed my eyes. I didn’t know exactly what Jamal was going to do with me, but I didn’t care. At least he was helping me. I closed my eyes. The pain was getting to extreme. I started puking again. I looked up at Jamal, he didn’t notice I was looking at him. He was more concentrated on flying and watching where he was going. Why am I so sick, I don’t understand it. 

     “Where are you…” I felt something come up my throat, so I just blurted out the rest of my sentence, “Taking me.” 

     “I don’t know. I’m just getting you somewhere you can lie down to be comfortable.” I looked around. My eyes started getting heavy. I felt really tired. I tried to keep my eyes open. I looked off a couple miles to see a building. I was to delusional to tell what the building was. What every it was, that’s where we were heading. That’s when I realized it wasn’t a building, it was just a house. It looked really familiar. I couldn’t pay attention anymore. I began to doze off. After I don’t how long, I was asleep. 

     “Zach, are you awake yet?” I was hearing Jamal’s voice fading in and out. I tried to open my eyes. I could see Jamal staring down at me. 

    “Where… Where are we?” I asked trying not to throw up. I expected to feel better when I woke up, but I didn’t. I must have the flu or something. I looked around. I looked beside the bed to see a grey basket. It must be my puke bucket. 

    “Well I read your mind, and your head told me this is your most favorite place to be.”

    “Do what. I’m not at…”

    “Kendra’s and Sydney’s house? Yep.” 

    “No! We need to leave right…” I suddenly felt a burst of puke come out. I put my face over the bucket and let it pour out. 

    “Why do we need to leave now birthday boy?” Jamal asked. Wow, I had completely forgot that it was my birthday. “Hey look what I found.” I looked over at Jamal. He wasn’t very good at holding things behind his back since I could see through him. It was my presents that Kendra had gotten me. He through three presents on my lap. I wasn’t really all that excited about it. “I have more good news.” Jamal blurted. I looked up at him with a dazed look. “I called the hospital and described your symptoms. You just have the normal 24 hour flu. Its been going around to everyone. That must be why there wasn’t anyone out today, its because they’re all sick.”

     “How long have I been asleep?” I asked.

     “About 3 hours. Open your presents!” Jamal seemed in a good mood. 

     “What time is it?” I started getting worried.

     “Its about 4:00. Why?” 

     “We have to leave now.”

     “Why, what’s the rush?”

     “You don’t understand, Kendra gets home at 4:00 and Sydney gets home at 4:10. So I really have to…” Suddenly the door flew open. I was in clear sight of Kendra. She stared at me and she ran over to the phone. “No don’t!” I yelled. Jamal shot down the hallway and tackled Kendra to the ground. Jamal held her hands down with his hands and her feet with his feet. I jumped up and ran out the door. The presents fell onto the floor. I ran out the door and around the house. Luckily I knew where everything was. I ran into the garage and grabbed a wooden bat. I ran over to the side of the house to see a metal box attached to the wall. I through the bat at it and busted open the box. I busted all of the fuses. I looked inside the house to see all the lights that were on go off. “Come on Jamal!” I yelled. I ran over in the doorway. Jamal jumped off of Kendra and flew over to the bed. “Jamal what are you doing.”

     “Can’t leave the presents.” Kendra jumped up and ran towards me. She didn’t even look that confused that she could see two of me. She was running closer and closer. I didn’t know what to do. Jamal wasn’t going to come back fast enough. So I closed my eyes lifted the bat and swung. I smashed the bat into Kendra’s face. He head flew into the opened door. Kendra slid down the wall. There was blood all over the bat and on the door. Kendra wasn’t dead but she was passed out. Jamal flew out of the door. He was carrying the presents in one hand and grabbed my collar in the other. We were flying up to the sky. I looked down to see Sydney’s bus pull up to the driveway. I just looked up and didn’t look back. I felt a tear go down my cheek. That wasn’t all I felt. I felt another burst of puke fly out. It went all over my shirt again. After about 3 minutes of flying we reached the barn that we were at earlier. Jamal set me down on the ground and we walked inside. I sat down on a pile of hay and started crying. I couldn’t stop. Jamal came over to me. “I know what will make you feel better.”

     “What?” I asked wiping my eyes. Jamal bent down and handed me a present. Oh well. I peeled off the wrapping paper to see what it was. It was a Hot Wheels race track complete with two hot wheel cars. I sat it down on the ground. Jamal handed me another. It was a new set of pajamas. I opened the last one. This one was a little stuffed animal from Sydney. It came with a card. I opened it up and twenty dollars fell out. I read the card:

_Happy 10__th_ _birthday. No matter what never change._

 _Your perfect just the way you are._ 

_We will always love you. From Kendra and Sydney._

  

     I put my face in my hand and started crying. They were so nice to me, and what do I do. I smash Kendra’s face in with a bat. I stopped crying for a second. I looked around. I smelt a horrible smell. I saw the man with a pitch fork in his stomach. 

    “Oh god! What have I done?” I ran over to the man and grabbed the pitch fork out of his stomach.

    “Whoa, watcha do’n?” Jamal asked in concern. I lifted the pitch fork above my head. Jamal jumped up and tackled me to the ground. “You do not do this. After everything that I’ve sacrificed for you, you can…”

    “For me! It’s been for you, everything. You just don’t want to die.”

    “No kidding. If you were in my position you would do the same thing. You know what. Let us go get Corey and…”

    “Us? No! From now on it’ll be me and me alone. Ever since I’ve met you, you’ve caused me nothing but trouble. If you’ve just stayed where you were supposed to, then I could be at home playing sonic with Chase!” I threw my hand up and punched me in the stomach. Jamal flew up in the air and held his head.

    “Don’t do that!” 

    “Forget you! I’ll do whatever the heck I want.” Jamal took a deep breath.

    “Ok, we’ll get through this. How about we forget this whole thing and just go get Corey. After we get Corey, we can get to Area 51.”

    “I don’t want to go anywhere with you!” I screamed.

    “That’s too bad!” Jamal jumped up and flew into my stomach. I sat there for a few seconds. Suddenly my stomach started hurting really bad. Then my chest. How is he doing this? 

    “Ok I’m sorry! We can go get Corey together, please stop!” Suddenly all the pains stopped. I didn’t even feel like I had the flu anymore. Jamal jumped out of my body. 

    “That’s better.” Jamal stopped there and grabbed me by the back of my neck. He lifted me off the ground and out of the barn doors. We flew straight for about thirty minutes without saying anything to each other. Finally I had to say something. 

    “I’m really hungry.” I looked up at Jamal, he looked agitated. So we flew for about another five minutes until we saw a little restaurant. Jamal put me down on the parking lot. “Stay here.” Jamal sat down beside a car. I walked inside and asked the lady if she had a map of Missouri I could use.

    “Sorry. I don’t have any maps, but if you need a map of Missouri you can go to the airport.”

    “Can you tell me where that is?” I asked. 

    “Yeah, but do you want to get washed up a little?” I looked at her confused. Of course, I’m covered in puke. She walked me over to the bathroom and took off my shirt. “Oh my god!” She screamed as she looked at me.

    “What?” I asked. She was looked at my pants. I looked down to see the gun that I had hid under my shirt in my pants. It was the gun Jamal gave me when he killed those police officers at that barn. “Oh. I’m so sorry. I completely forgot about that.” She took a big long look at me for a second. 

   “Your Zach! From the news.”

   “Crap.” I started running out the bathroom door.

   “Stop him!” The lady yelled. A dirty, fat man ran out of the kitchen. I ran out the front door.

   “Zach?” Jamal looked at me confused.

   “Let’s go!”

   “Where’s your shirt?” Jamal asked.

   “Never mind, go, go, go!” Jamal picked me up and we flew off. I knew that right now, that lady was calling the police and telling them that I am heading towards the airport. So I can’t go to the airport now. But where? “Where else has a map besides the airport?”

   “Um… a library?” Jamal suggested. Of course a library. But where is the nearest library? Luckily it just happened that we flew right over a library. 

   “Down there Jamal! Go down!” So Jamal slowly put me on the ground. I ran over to the door and went to the front corner. 

   “Um sir…” The lady said as she pointed to a poster on the door. I looked over at it. 

  

_No Shirt_

_No Shoes_

_No Service_

   “Yeah, about that…” I didn’t know what to say. That’s when I remembered the gun in my pants. I don’t think that she had seen it yet. “Can you just tell me where the atlas is? I promise I’ll check it out and be on my way.”

   “I’m sorry young man, you’ll have to leave.”

   “Fine, I’ll find it myself.” I told the woman. I walked over looking down the library isles. The librarian picked up the phone.

   “Security, Security to front desk.” After the woman hung up the phone, I didn’t know what else to do. I pulled the gun out of my pants and pointed it at her.

   “Mam, I’ve had a really bad week. So you could really help me out if you pick up that phone and told security not to come.” So the librarian picked up the phone and told them not to come. She hung up the phone and put one hand up in the air. I would her expect her to put both arms up but she didn’t. Her other hand was under the desk. She was pressing that button to call the police. I knew that was what she was doing so I closed my eyes and ran down the isle. “Atlas, atlas where’s the atlas.” Then I found it. I picked it up and ran outside the librarian was calling the police on her phone. “Go, Go!” I screamed to Jamal.

    “See this is the second time today you’ve ran out of building telling me to hurry up and leave.” He flew over to me and picked me up. He flew me over the top of the library. I opened the atlas in mid air. Trying to hold the pages open I looked for Missouri. I found it on page 31. I looked then for Jackson County and then Independence. I kept it open to that page. I told Jamal which direction to head. We were flying through the sky for about 2 hours and then it started getting dark. At the speed we were going we had to have been at least a state over. Jamal put me down on the ground by a tree. I showed Jamal everywhere we would have to go to get back to Missouri. It had to have been at least 11:00 when I fell asleep. That next morning I made sure I was covered in brush. Luckily I wasn’t. I looked down at my stomach and punched myself lightly. Jamal jumped out of my body. “Just say something when you want my attention okay!” Jamal ordered me. Jamal was hovering above the ground. I stood up and stretched.

    “Well, we should head off if we want to get to Missouri today.” I looked off to see the sun start coming up. I had a feeling that it was going to be a good day. I ran over to Jamal and put my arms out.

    “What?” He asked.

    “Well, are you going to pick me up?” 

    “Jeez!” Jamal lifted me up and we started flying towards the sky. That’s when I remembered the atlas.

    “Wait we forgot the atlas!” I told Jamal. So we went back to the ground, I picked it up and we were off again. I really wish that I had a shirt because it was really cold. I opened the atlas and held the pages open. I pointed to where Jamal had to go. We passed a lot of cool sights. We went over valleys, rivers, and roads. Jamal started getting tired of flying so he put me on the ground and we just walked around. We were in a small little town with nice people. No big buildings or noisy cars. Just little nice people. Jamal and I walked into a little house. There was a man sitting in a chair watching TV. He was really nice. He didn’t even care that we just barged into his house. 

    “What can I do for you boys.”

    “Don’t kill him!” I whispered to Jamal.

    “I won’t gosh!” 

    “So, what state are we in?” I asked the man.

    “Well you’re in Illinois.”

    “Illinois! Yes! Only one state away from Missouri.” 

    “Are you okay young man?” The man asked Jamal.

    “What?” Jamal asked.

    “Well, I can see through you and you’re floating above the ground.”

    “Well…” Jamal began. “I fell into some toxic waste.” 

    “Oh, that explains it. So where are you boys heading?” 

    “Area 51.” I blurted out. 

    “Area 51 you say. Have fun!” 

    “We will.” I said. Jamal picked me up and flew me out the window. I had a pretty good feeling that guy was senile. We flew on for about another hour. Suddenly things began looking familiar. It was my old town. I was back in Missouri. Jamal was going to my old street. He put me down on the road. He floated next to me as I walked down to me old house. I wasn’t planning on ever coming back here again, but I couldn’t help it. I stood in front of my house for about 20 seconds. That’s when I realized my mom had gotten a new car. I turned around to look at chase’s old house. It looked the same as it did before. I was thinking about getting some stuff from my house if I never plan on coming back. I noticed that Chase’s house had no one in it. All the lights were off and the car was on. I walked over to their house and opened the door. I remembered that Chase’s dad never locked the door. I remembered also that my mom didn’t have caller ID. I knew that I had to get my mom out of the house if I wanted to get my stuff. So I called my mom on Chase’s dads phone. 

     “Hello?” My mom answered. I cleared my throat and lowered my deep as low as I could.

     “Um, hello is this Ms. Thompson?”

     “This is Mrs. Thompson.” I felt my stomach fall. Mrs. Thompson! She remarried? Who though? “Can I help you?” 

     “Yes. We found your son. He’s down in the station if you want to see him before he’s locked up.” 

     “Oh my god! Yes of course!” I hung up the phone and looked out the window to see my mom jump in the car and drive off. So me and Jamal ran out the door and into my house. I ran over to my room and through open the door. Nothing had changed. I opened my closet door and grabbed a shirt. I pulled it on over my gun. I ran over to the kitchen and grabbed some peanut butter and jelly and bread. I made a quick sandwich and ran over to the dining room. My moms purse was on the table. I opened it up and pulled out her wallet. She had about thirty dollars. I ran back to my room and grabbed my library card. I ran over to my moms room to spit on her pillows but what I saw scared my so much. The doctor that told me I had a twin brother was asleep on my mom’s bed. My mom married the doctor. I really didn’t want to wake him so I slowly walked out of the room trying not to wake him. But Jamal wasn’t in the room with me. So he didn’t know that the doctor was in there. Jamal yelled to me trying to tell me something.

    “Hey Zach, should we kill mom when she gets back?” I knew he was joking but I wish he didn’t say anything. The doctor jumped up and stared at me. 

    “Zach! It’s you!” He ran over to the closet and pulled out a rifle. He pointed it at me. I couldn’t move, I was too scared. Jamal came running in the door. “Oh my god. You weren’t crazy!” The doctor pointed out. “You really did see another one of yourselves.” Jamal ran over to the doctor and went into his body. Jamal made the doctor put the gun to his head. I closed my eyes. With in a couple seconds the doctor was on the ground with blood pouring out of his head. 

    “Come on!” Jamal yelled jumping out of the doctor. He grabbed my arm and pulled my out of the house. Jamal lifted me up and we flew off. We headed for the public library. It only took a few minutes for us to get there. I ran inside trying not to let anyone see my face. Jamal jumped into my body as I walked inside. I walked over to the computer and looked up maps for Independence, Missouri. After about 10 minutes of searching I found the Juvenile Hall nearest to us. That’s probably the one he was sent to. So Jamal and I walked out of the library without anyone seeing me. Jamal jumped out of my body and lifted me up. We started flying up to the sky. Jamal remembered where we had to go, so I didn’t have to tell him. After a few minutes we got there. Jamal put me down on the ground and he jumped back into my body. I walked casually inside. I walked to the front desk. 

     “Hello, I’d like to speak with Corey Jefferson.” 

The man talked into a little microphone. “Prisoner 63596, you have a visitor.” The security man walked me over to where I could talk with him. I reached a glass wall with little phones on the sides. I picked up one and waited for Corey. It took about 5 minutes for Corey to get there. 

    “Waz up Corey?” 

    “Zach? Zach is that you?” Corey seemed very excited.

    “Yeah it is.”

    “Wow, I am so happy to see you. It’s a nightmare in this place. Did you ever catch your twin brother?” I didn’t say anything. I looked to both sides to see if any guards were looking. Suddenly Jamal popped his head out of my shoulder like I had two heads. “Sweet!” 

    “I know. Guess where we’re headed.”

    “I don’t know.”

    “Area 51!”

    “Are you serious. Well, when you come back tell me how it was.”

    “We didn’t come here just to tell you. We’re taking you with you.”

    “Obviously you don’t understand, I’m in jail.”

    “That’s why we’re going to brake you out.”

    “How are you going to do that?” Corey asked. Jamal immediately jumped out of my body, through the glass and into Corey.

    “Now go back to your cell. Jamal will do the rest.” I told Corey. So I walked out and was heading for the exit. That’s when I was stopped my the security guard. 

    “Where do you think Your going Zach Thompson?” The guard asked.

    “Crap!” I tried to get away from him but he grabbed my arm before I could get out. He pushed me back the concrete floor.

    “You’ve done some unbelievable things, you know that?” The guard asked. “You’re not getting away from me.” I jumped up and ran back the other way. The guard ran after me. He was really big, but he was still fast. Not faster than me though. I ran around every corner I could to get away from him. But it didn’t stop him. It only made more guards come. They all chased after me. I thought that it was going pretty good since I was faster than all of them. But what I didn’t expect on, a guard blocked my path. I ran into him and fell back. Three guards picked me up while one took a night stick and hit me in my head. I was out of it. Later that day, I woke up with a terrible headache. I had completely forgot about everything that was going on. “Morn’n sleepy head!” One guard said. I looked around to see where I was. I was on a bench connected to a cement wall. The guard was talking to me through a bar wall. I was locked up in a little cell with one toilet and a sink. There was a small window at the top of the little room. Suddenly I remembered why I was here. Right whenever I was about to say something an intercom came on, “Code red! Code red! We have a brake out on western corridor! Code red! Corey Jefferson and Caitlyn Riffle!” Caitlyn Riffle? Who’s that. Could Jamal have helped a girl get out too? I looked up at the guard who was talking to me. He pulled out his night stick and ran off down the hall. Now I was all alone in my little cell. At least Corey is out. Hopefully Jamal will notice I’m not out there and come back for me. So there is nothing I can do right now but sit back and wait. I waited and waited. I walked over to the bars and looked at the clock. It said 8:00. Since it was dark I expected it to be night time. I began to wonder if they were coming back for me. Suddenly the guard walked over to me. 

“I’ve got some bad news. You see the state doesn’t trust that we are fit enough to hold a captive like you, speaking of since you’ve killed over 20 people. So, we have to take you to the national penitentiary.” The man reached his hand over to the side of the bars and put a key in the hole. He through the bars open and threw a pair of handcuffs on me. He grabbed me by my shirt and started pulling me down the hall way. I walked passed about twenty people in their prison cells. They all looked extremely depressed. As the man pulled me out the doors of the prison into where the prisoners have recess. There was a large van waiting for me. I knew that if my twin wasn’t coming back, or he couldn’t find me, then I would have to escape now, or it would be too late. I looked around for the nearest place I could run too. There was no where. There were guards everywhere. I mite as well try to escape later. So the guard threw me into the back of the van. I couldn’t see the driver, it was like a little room attached to a car. The man took the doors and locked them shut. 

There was only one window and it was on the doors. I did all I could to get my hands loose. Except the handcuffs were too tight. I stood up and looked out the window to see the guard starring me in the face. Suddenly the van started moving. I flew back on my butt. I looked around to see if there is any way I could get out. That’s when I saw a little camera in the corner of the room. The drive must be watching me up front. I stood back up and looked back out the window. The prison was getting smaller and smaller. I could just indistinctly see about fifty guards standing outside looking up. I looked up to see what they were looking at. There was Jamal, holding two other people in his hands, flying up into the sky. Now it was just a matter of time before he comes to get me. Suddenly I saw one the guards grab a gun and aim it up in the air. “NO!” I  screamed, but of course they couldn’t hear me. That’s when the van turned a corner to where I couldn’t see them anymore. 

He could kill Corey or that other girl with them. After all that, Corey can’t die. He can’t. There was nothing I could do except sit and wait for Jamal to come and get me. I looked up at the camera and walked up to it. I jumped up and hit my head into it. The camera tilted upward so it couldn’t see me. That’s when the van abruptly stopped. I went flying back and slammed my face into the doors. I looked out the window to see the driver walk over to the doors and put the key in the hole. He threw the doors open. He was stupid enough to jump into the van. He pushed me down onto my back. I waited for him to get as far to the corner as possible. Once his back was turned to me, he put the camera back how it was supposed to go. Now was my chance. I jumped out of the van and threw the doors shut. It was extremely hard to do because my hands were still behind my back in handcuffs. The idiot left the keys in the door. I locked the doors and took the keys out of the door. I put the keys behind my back and tried to find a key that mite fit in the handcuffs.

 I looked up at the mirror of the van to see a man sitting in a passenger seat. I only thought there was a driver, and that was it. I don’t think that the man had seen me yet. I would have to try and get my handcuffs off later. Now I had to run away. So I ran as fast as I could away. It was all plain land everywhere, there was no where to hide. I was bound to be caught. Luckily I was far enough away from the prison for anyone down there to see me. I looked around again. The only place I could possibly go was to a hill of trees about a mile away. I ran and ran, but there was no way I could go all the way there. It was getting a lot darker now.  

After about 2 minutes of constantly running, felt my leg start to hurt really bad. It hurt so bad that I fell to the ground. I tried not to cream in pain. I bit my finger to hold it in. I pulled up my pants leg to look at what happened. My stitched had ripped open. It hurt so bad. I had to keep going or else they would find me; except I can’t run or else I would pass out from the pain. So I pushed myself back onto my feet and limped as far as I could. I could feel my leg start to get numb. That was a good thing right? I could feel my tear run down my cheeks. I didn’t even really know why I was crying. I didn’t know if it was the pain or the fact that if im caught I’ll be in a load of crap. 

Once I reached the first couple of trees of the hill. I had to take a break to catch my breath. I sat down by a tree and looked around. I didn’t want to go to far into the woods, especially what happened last time. I also didn’t want to get eaten by any animals. I knew that any minute now I would start to hear a bunch of sirens coming towards me. I still wish that I knew where Jamal was. I didn’t know what to do about my legs. I’m no doctor, so I had know idea what to do in situation like this. I just took some deep breaths and ripped off the sleeve of my shirt. I wrapped my wound as tight as I could. I could feel my head getting heavy. It felt like I was about to pass out. I put my head back against the tree and closed my eyes. I began to think if I was ever going to have another normal day again. My body slid down and I started to doze off. Surprisingly I was able to fall asleep after everything that was going on. 

  

That next morning I found myself in a different place I was that last night. Had the cops found me and taken me back to prison. No, I was still outside. But what happened? I looked up to see Corey sitting next to a girl. They were talking. “Corey?..... Corey!” I jumped up and ran over to him. If I was gay, I would’ve given him a hug. I’m not so I didn’t. “Corey you….. look different.” He did. He had long hair and about a trillion pimples all over his face. His muscles were a lot bigger and he had lost a lot of weight. “What happened? And who’s this?” 

“Um, I decided since I was in prison, I mite as well work out a little. And the girl is Caitlyn Riffle. My girlfriend.” 

“Oh that’s cool. Can talk to you over hear?” I pulled Corey over, away from Caitlyn’s hearing range. “We can’t take her with us! All she is going to do is hold us up, we’ll never reach Area 51 with her with us.”

“Either both of us go or neither of us.”

“Ok obviously you don’t understand what I’ve gone through to get you out of prison to go with us! I’ve almost died at least 5 times in the past week!”

“Do you wanna make it 6?”

“Im sorry, di--- did you just threaten me?”

“Yes I did.”

“Ok listen here! I…..” Suddenly Jamal jumped out of Corey’s stomach and flew in between us. 

“Hey!” Jamal started. “Let’s not get into a fight!” 

“But….” I stammered.

“No! We’re taking her with us!” Jamal told me.

“Um, excuse me?”

“Listen, it’s not that big of a deal. She’s not going to be that hard to take care of.”

“How long have you been in his stomach?” I asked.

“I slept there last night.”

“You slept in someone else’s body?” I asked.

“What are you jealous?” He asked. Suddenly I had the feeling everyone was ganging up on me. I hasn’t about to have every put me down so I punched myself in the stomach as hard as I could. Jamal fell to the ground. 

“Yeah! It doesn’t feel to good now does it?” I asked Jamal. He jumped back onto his feet. I looked over at Corey. Based on the size of his muscles, there was no way I could beat him up. So I decided to reason with him. “Corey, we’re going to Area 51 and we’re going to bring Chase back to life.”

“What?” He didn’t seem the least bit convinced. “There is no Area 51, and even if there was, you can’t bring people back to life.”

“No! There is an Area 51 and you can bring people back to life with a machine my dad was working on!”

“Your dad is dead! What is wrong with you!” That’s when Jamal jumped in.

“Actually to tell you the truth, there is an Area 51 and his dad is working on a machine to bring people back to life. But he is probably finished with it by now since he was working on it 10 years ago.”

“Now how do you know?” Corey asked Jamal.

“You see, when your born. You get all the knowledge from your mom and dad inside your head but you…”

“He just knows ok!” I didn’t want to hear him go through all that again. 

“So you actually believe this crap?” Corey asked.

“To tell you the truth, I do. Why would he lie about something like this?” I asked looking back at Jamal. 

“Yeah!” He yelled.

“Well, I’m convinced!” Caitlyn said. So Corey just decided to come. He still didn’t seem like he believed us. We all looked back over at Jamal.

“What?” He asked.

“How are we supposed to get there?” Corey asked.

“Umm….. I don’t know. How about…. We steal a car?” 

“Sounds good to me.” Caitlyn began, “Where are we supposed to find a car?” We all began to think. 

“What about a parking lot?” I suggested.

“Do you see a parking lot anywhere?” Corey asked. I looked around. It was rocks, grass and trees everywhere.

“Well, we can just start walking.” Jamal said. So we all looked straight and started walking. “We’re off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!” 

“Shut up!” All three of us yelled at Jamal. Actually, it really wasn’t bothering me. I don’t know why I said shut up. It must be Corey. His evil was rubbing off on me. All of us looked off in directions to try and find a store, or a road. Except we had to make sure not to get seen because Corey, Caitlyn and I were still in our prison clothes. Of course Jamal had nothing to worry about. Even if he was caught he could just fly away. 

After about 20 minutes of walking our tempers began to rise. I was getting extremely frustrated. Every one could tell Corey was because he kept yelling and threatening us. Caitlyn didn’t seem to say much the entire time we were walking, like she was hiding something. I never really trusted her, I didn’t know what she was up to, but I knew it couldn’t be good. If it was up to me, I would’ve just deserted her and only Jamal, Corey and I go. However, I knew that if we deserted her, Corey would desert us. It’s not like he was a big help to the group, but after all that trouble getting him out of prison, I wasn’t about to let him leave.

“How long has it been?” Jamal asked.

“I don’t know, but I’m getting really mad!” Corey said.

“Wait,” I began. “Jamal, you can fly!”

“No der!” Jamal sassed back.

“You can fly up into the sky and you can have a better view on where we’re headed.” I don’t know why I hadn’t thought of it before. So Jamal jumped up and flew up into the sky. We all looked up covering the sun from our eyes. Jamal twisted in a circle and looked everywhere. 

“Ok, I have some bad news and some worse news.” Jamal Began as he floated back to the ground.

“Ok, what’s the bad news?” I asked.

“The bad news is that there is a huge storm headed this way.”

“And the worse news?” Caitlyn asked.

“I found a parking lot. Except its about 10 miles that way.” Jamal pointed in the opposite direction we were heading.

“Oh come on!” Corey screamed. 

“Are you sure there isn’t a house or a little store in the way we’re walking?” I asked. 

“No.” Jamal replied.  

“Well, might as well turn around.” Caitlyn said. So we al twisted around and started walking the other direction.

“Jamal, isn’t there any way you could get us there any faster?” I asked.

“Well…. No, no.”

“Yeah! What is it?” Corey whined.

“I can carry at most two of you and fly you over to the parking lot. Then I could turn around and come get the other one.”

“Well, let’s go then.” Corey and Caitlyn walked forward.

“What makes you think you guys get to go first?” I asked.

“Well, because we’re a couple.” Caitlyn answered. 

“What? That doesn’t even make sense.” It was obvious to me that Caitlyn wasn’t the smartest of the bunch. Jamal grabbed both Caitlyn and Corey and hovered above the ground for a few seconds. 

“We’ll be right back.” Jamal said.

“Wait! When will you be back?” I asked. But it was too late, they were to high to hear. Then they shot off. So I sat down on a small boulder beside me and waited, and waited, and waited. I could’ve swore that when I was flying with Jamal it only took like one minute to get a mile. Since he had double the weight this time it might take double the time. So I decided to be patient. But after 30 minutes of waiting, it was getting ridiculous. I knew the way I could get Jamal’s attention. I stood up and punched myself at hard as I could in my stomach. I looked up in the sky. He wasn’t there. So I punched myself again and again. Nothing. I guess I would just punch myself over and over until he came. Except after a while it started to hurt really bad.

I just laid down on the ground and slightly tapped my stomach over and over again. I starred up in the sky for a few minutes nothing. “Where could he be?” I asked myself. I don’t think that he could’ve gotten lost from me. Since he found me at Kendra’s a long time ago. I was getting really agitated. I jumped up on my feet and looked around. Nothing…. Wait. There was something coming straight toward me really fast. Of course it was Jamal. He was going right through the trees. Suddenly he slammed right into my stomach, I went flying backward at least five feet. Jamal Jumped out of my stomach.

“Why did you punch me!” He screamed.

“You weren’t coming!” I yelled.

“I was staying over there until Caitlyn got the car hot wired!”

“You could’ve gotten me and then went back over there!”

“Fine! Let’s go.” Jamal picked me up and shot above the trees and to that parking lot. It only took a few seconds. He put me down on my feet. He floated over to Caitlyn and asked what he was supposed to do. She was talking about all these different colored wires and stuff. Once she was done Jamal jumped up and shot into the car. After about 10 seconds of waiting, all the lights of the car came on and the engine started running.

“Wait, that’s all you had to do? Why did it take you so long to come back and get me?” I asked. No one answered. They were ignoring me. I don’t know what I did, but everyone was really mad at me for some reason. I jumped in the front seat of the car, Corey and Caitlyn jumped in the back. Jamal walked came over to me.

“Umm, what’s going on?” 

“Get in.” I told him.

“You remember what happened last time. I’m driving!”

“No! I’m a better driver. Get in the passenger seat.”

“No! I am. Move!” I rolled my eyes and pulled off the emergency break.” Jamal shot through the car window and into my body. He had told me before that he couldn’t control my body, I don’t know why he told me that because it was a lie. He made me get out of the car, walk around and sit down in the passenger seat. Jamal shot out of my body and into the driver’s seat. 

“Hey!” I screamed. Jamal didn’t reply. She just put his foot down on the gas pedal and we started leaving the parking lot. I put the seat belt. Corey put his seat belt on too. Caitlyn didn’t. 

“You might wanna put that on!” Corey told her.

“It’s fine, I don’t need it.”

“You see, we’ve had some pretty bad incidents in cars.” I told her. She looked over at Corey. He agreed with me. She slid her seatbelt on. Jamal took his seatbelt and put it on. It just went right through his body and pushed up against the back of the seat. He looked over at me and smiled like it was a joke. I didn’t smile.

“What is your problem!” He screamed out of no where.

“Excuse me?” I asked.

“You wanna know why I’ve been being mean to you? It’s because you just can’t take a joke!” 

“Oh yeah! I’m supposed to laugh at a guy who has killed tons of people!”

“I haven’t killed tons!” Jamal began, “No more than anyone else.”

“Yes! A lot more than everyone else!” Jamal didn’t reply. He just looked back ahead. We were on the road by now and heading North (I could tell by the little compass on the car). “Do you know where we’re going?” I asked.

“Yes! I’m not stupid!” We all paused for a second.

“Well?” 

“Well what?” He asked.

“Which way are we supposed to be going?”

“Oh…… Um……” Jamal had forgotten.

“AHHHH!” I screamed. I threw my fist up in the air and punched myself as hard as I could in the stomach. Jamal’s hands went off the stirring wheel and he held his head. The car began to turn off the road. I grabbed the wheel and put us back on the road. Jamal put his hands back on the wheel.

“Don’t do that!” He screamed.

“Hey. Twenty bucks says we’re on the radio.” Corey said. So I reached over to the radio and turned it on. I flipped through the channels trying to find something about us. 

“Your listening to KKBLEGDJ….” I turned the station.

“Tomorrow’s weather will be cloudy and….”

“If you want to speak to Arrow Smith, then call. 1-999-84…..”

“Stacy’s mom has got it going on…..”

“And Corey Jeffer…..”  

“And therefore….” 

“Wait!” Corey said. “turn it back!” I turned it back.

“Riffle escaped from prison today. But that isn’t the strangest thing that happened. They had actually captured Zachary Thompson while he was visiting his old friend. Luckily we now have him in custody. Another good thing is that they caught Corey and Caitlyn later that day.” I flipped off the radio. 

“Liar! I’m not in custody and neither are you two!” I screamed.

“Why would they do that?” Caitlyn asked.

“I don’t know, but I say that we pay Mrs. News Reporter a little visit.” Corey said.

“How bout no!” Jamal said.

“Yeah.” I began, “It will just give us more of a chance to get caught.” 

“Don’t you think we should be concentrating on how to get to Area 51?” Jamal asked.

“Should we steal a map?” I asked. 

“Yeah!” Corey said. “Of course. We could get a map that knows exactly where Area 51 is.”

“Well do you think that going to Area 51 is that important?” Caitlyn asked.

“We must go to Area 51!” Jamal yelled.

“Why do you want to go so bad?” I asked.

“Um…. I… to bring your friend back to life!”

“Why did you think about it?” I knew that Jamal was getting very pressured. “Answer me Jamal!” I yelled.

“I forgot for a second ok!” He was  lying. What did he know that we didn’t? I decided not to worry about it for now.
