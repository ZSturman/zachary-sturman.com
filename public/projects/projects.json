    "description": "This project is a coloring book that traces the major moments in history through a series of hand-drawn illustrations. Each page is designed to be both informative and interactive, offering a way to learn by engaging directly with the content. The drawings were made in the Sketch app on an iPad using an Apple Pencil, combining the precision of digital tools with the personal rhythm of hand-drawing. The idea was simple: to create something that made the vast scope of history more approachable, and maybe a little easier to remember through the act of coloring. It’s meant for anyone curious about how everything fits together, from the beginnings of life to the stories that shaped our world.",

    "story": "This project began after I finished working on my TV pilot, at a time when I was watching a lot of PBS Eons and reading about science and early life. I missed drawing, especially the slower work of creating backgrounds for Greenhorn, but I’ve always struggled to make art just for relaxation. I like having a purpose, something that builds toward an idea. The coloring book came out of that mix of curiosity and restlessness. I thought it might be interesting to make something that catalogues the history of everything, page by page, in a form people could participate in. For a while it was deeply satisfying—the research, the drawing, the sense of watching time unfold visually. Eventually, though, it started to feel less like exploration and more like obligation, so I stopped. Looking back, I think it served its purpose. It gave me a reason to draw again, to think about history in a different way, and to let the process be enough, even if the project itself remains unfinished.",

    "description": "This project was my first screenplay after film school, written as part of an application to the NBC Writing Program. The story centers on three homeless men who find discarded suit jackets and decide to act as if they belong in the world of those who wear them. What begins as a simple idea about pretending to fit in grows into a reflection on how much of society is built on appearance and performance. The script looks at identity from the outside in—how clothing, confidence, and perception can briefly bridge the gap between exclusion and belonging. It’s a small, contained story, but it held the beginnings of what I wanted to explore as a writer: the tension between how people are seen and who they really are.",

    "story": " I wrote this not long after finishing film school, at a point when I was still figuring out what kind of stories I wanted to tell. I heard about the NBC Writing Program and needed a screenplay to apply, so I started writing without much of a plan. The idea came quickly—two homeless men find suit jackets and start pretending to be someone else. It felt honest at the time, maybe because I was also trying to figure out my own place in the world. Later, after moving to New York and then to Anchorage, I met more people living on the streets and saw how complicated their lives were. I realized my story hadn’t touched that depth. If I were to write it now, I’d approach it differently—with more awareness, more care for what I didn’t understand back then. Still, that first script mattered. It taught me how to take an idea from nothing, how to finish something imperfect, and how experience keeps reshaping the way I see what I once thought I knew.",

    "description": "This project began as an early attempt to tell a story about family, loyalty, and the uneasy choices that come with protecting someone you love. At its core, it follows a family drawn into covering up a crime committed by one of their own, each member forced to confront what they’re willing to sacrifice for the others. It was the first piece of writing I ever registered for copyright, and in many ways, it marked the start of taking storytelling seriously. I wrote it before film school, before I knew much about process or pacing or revision, but it carried the first signs of wanting to understand people through story. Though I never finished a proper edit, the drafts taught me what it means to shape an idea beyond instinct—to sit with it, rework it, and see where it resists.",

The story came from a question that stayed with me: what would a family do to protect one of their own, and how far would that loyalty stretch before it broke? I wrote draft after draft, each one a little different, not because I had a plan but because I was learning what rewriting meant. At the time, I thought finishing a draft was the finish line, not the midpoint. It was also the first time I went through the process of copyrighting something, which made it feel strangely official, like proof that it existed beyond my computer. Looking back, it’s rough and unfinished, but it’s also where I began to understand how stories take shape—slowly, unevenly, and often before you know what kind of storyteller you’re trying to become.",

    "story": "For the latest version, I focused on detail. I added parallax effects, smoother animations, and an SVG self-portrait that adapted to light and dark mode. It was a chance to connect everything I’d learned—Python, React, animation, and design—into one project that felt cohesive. Each version of this portfolio marks a stage in my learning, not just in coding, but in understanding how to build something that grows with me.",

It unified previous learning into a cohesive, expressive, and technically mature portfolio. The latest iteration emphasizes design and motion, introducing smooth parallax scrolling, layered animation effects, and a self-designed SVG character whose colors shift with light and dark mode.",
