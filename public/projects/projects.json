    "description": "The first version of my portfolio was built with Flask, following Corey Schafer’s tutorials as a starting point. It was my introduction to web development and a way to learn how all the pieces of a site come together. I set up my own server, configured Nginx, and handled deployment myself, not realizing that most people used simpler options. It was a long process, full of trial and error, but it gave me a deep understanding of how a web application actually runs. I designed my own SVG graphics and added simple hover animations to make it feel personal. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked, and I was proud of it.",
