    "description": "ChewSense is an iOS app that helps people slow down while they eat and pay more attention to their habits. It uses the motion sensors in AirPods to pick up chewing—mainly through X-axis acceleration—and gives gentle alerts when someone might be eating too fast. The app records motion and optional video so it can learn a person’s eating pattern and adjust over time. The goal is simple: improve digestion, avoid overeating, and make meals feel more mindful without asking the user to track anything manually.",

I originally assumed I’d have to build my own hardware to detect chewing, which is why I bought a 3D printer and began experimenting with custom sensors. That approach got complicated fast. Instead, I looked for something people already use every day. When I found out AirPods could actually pick up chewing through their motion data, I tested it and saw that the X-axis readings were consistent enough to use. From there, I built two iOS app versions that could record motion and video while someone eats. Working through it showed me that you don’t always need custom hardware—sometimes the tools we already have are good enough to bring an idea to life.",

    "description": "MediLedger is designed around a simple idea: most of what you need to do with your medication shouldn’t require opening an app. With interactive widgets, you can log a full or half dose, check how many pills you have left, see when your refill is coming up, and set up different widgets for different medications. The app handles both prescription and non-prescription meds, tracks strength and dosage, and keeps a full history of what you’ve taken. Everything syncs through SwiftData across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and it works offline when it needs to. You can customize what each widget shows, set up alerts for refills, and rely on automatic calculations to keep your supply accurate without any extra effort.",

I spent a lot of time figuring out how much a widget could handle: what buttons made sense, what info people would need at a glance, and how to keep things clean without stripping away control. The goal wasn’t to build a perfect app; it was to learn what happens when the widget becomes the main interaction surface. Eventually, I want this to connect with Trackables so all these small bits of daily data live in one place and start forming patterns that actually help people. It’s still early, but it feels like the right direction.",

Around the same time, I started experimenting with QueueCards, which became an early version of what would later become my app Top Note.

It takes a simpler approach: one reminder, flashcard, or note at a time. You can complete it or skip it, and if you skip, it returns sooner through a spaced repetition system that keeps important things visible.\n\nThis design encourages accountability and steady progress. It helps build habits, strengthen memory, and keep personal ideas within reach—without the noise of endless lists.\n\nWhy it works\nTop Note combines two familiar ideas: single-task focus and spaced repetition. Together they keep your attention on what matters next, reinforcing memory and consistency over time.\n\nFeatures\n– One-at-a-time reminders that reduce distraction.\n– Skip and repeat so skipped items return sooner.\n– Spaced repetition flashcards for better recall.\n– Widget-first design that keeps the app close at hand.\n– Flexible note support for quotes, goals, or brief thoughts.\n– Simple setup inside the app; most use happens in the widget.\n\nBest for\n– People who often dismiss reminders.\n– Habit tracking and reinforcement.\n– Short study or review sessions.\n– Keeping a meaningful note visible through the day.\n\nTop Note makes productivity manageable by narrowing your focus. Instead of managing a list, you engage with one small task—and let time handle the rest.",
