Empathetic Thoughts
- idea
- horror
- short story
summary: In a world where people want to reform instead of punish a device to created so someone can truly feel what someone was thinking in the moment of a terrible crime to figure out what might have gone wrong, but it back fires and instead it alters the thought process of the person trying to empathize and that person can't find anything wrong with the terrible act and people start to rape and murder because people slowly stop seeing the harshness of their actions because they can always justify them

NO NOTES TO REFERENCE FOR THESE:

Microsoft paint + opencv




**App Idea - Access to Calendar**
- If new event marked “Meeting” - automate reminders that pop up:

- 1 day before: “Buy blueberries and Bananas”
- 45 min before: “Take ibuprofen” 
- 30 min before: “Eat bananas”
- 15 min before: “Drink water”
- 10 min before: “Do pushups”
- 5 min before: “Blueberries”
- 2 min before: “Water. Eye wipes. Eye drops”




**Inspiration for Python Project**

**App idea - empathy** 

Inspired by righteous mind  - Take 16 personalities like test
Use LLM to translate political views into something you can understand




Mocap App

Record Video of moving - Add bones in between bones + joint constraints and resistance and stuff
Ex: turn an arm into a tentacle 




Tauri app 

meant for being a monitor for changes in your life. 
Changes include:
- Moving to a new place
- Trying a prescription 
- Starting a new shift at work
- Going on a diet
- Having a child
- Or just tracking changes from different points in time

Things that can be input are:
- Test results from:
	- 16personalities
	- YourMorals
	- Implicit Biases
- DNA results:
	- 23 and me
- Health:
	- Apple fitness
	- heart
	- sleep
	- weight
- Mental state
	- Journals
	- Mood tracking in apple
	- Distractions
	- Screen time
- Other stuff like:
	- short term memory test
	- long term
	- Wheres waldo/ iSpy type tests
	- Memory game test
	- Tongue Twisters
	- Communication skills
Possible tests to do On app
Can you tell how much time has passed? 10 min? 120 seconds?



Obsidian People Journal

**App**
Simple animations showing the simulations of items at different scales
You can zoom in and out to see them
- Quarks
- Atoms
- Molecules
- Cells
- ...
- Human
- City
- Weather Patters
- Geology
- General Relativity
Maybe this can lead to showing why GR and QM don't mesh



**App**
Feeling a bit off? 

- do you have a to do list made? 
- Have you slept? 
- Have you eaten? 
- Water?



**App that is meant to** 

Show the others point of view, 

Hook:
- "how do I get them to understand" is the wrong question 
- You can't 
- Instead( ask yourself if you understand 
Small questionnaire see get your point of view 
Stories from righteous mind 
Inspiration is Crystal, who proved to me I don't know what's in anyone else's head




**Psychology study** 

Think of some set of questions to ask participants to find out if they have a strong intuition that there is a "puppet master" controlling everything 

- inspiration is Josh's inability to accept the fact that it's physics controlling things and not our choices or god or a simulation



**AR app.** 

Map your house. Then based on the house layout have the ability to make it different exhibits in the museum. 


Calculate square feet, different rooms (so each room is a different exhibit)



**App idea** 

Think Marco Polo meets podcast meets interview. You and a friend talking but a specific number of questions there can only be one person answering. For instance, for 5 questions only one person can ask




**App**

  

Marco Polo but you can go back and edit / refilm part of it






**An app** 

That lets you get an understanding of people's mindsets during different periods of time about different topics. 

  

Future addition is change by social class, age and region. 

  

Example: 

- what did people during the civil war think about the world? Did they know about f=ma?



**Resale Price API**
- Get the current going rate for the item
- Get how much people are selling it for on ebay and stuff
- Find out what price people are paying for it
