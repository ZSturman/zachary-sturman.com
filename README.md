# Zachary Sturman Portfolio

This repository showcases my creative, scientific, and technological projects.

## Project Organization

This codebase uses a `pre-build.py` script to automatically add and update my current projects. This approach allows me to maintain a single source of truth for all my projects on my local machine, ensuring consistency and ease of management.

To see the full implementation of this project organization system, check out the **OPE** project, which is featured in my portfolio at [zachary-sturman.com](https://zachary-sturman.com).
